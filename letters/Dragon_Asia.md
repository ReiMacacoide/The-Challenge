Yellow, Dear Dragon of Fire. 

You don't kill me, because You shall not!

You Love me, because You shall do!

You need to dream, You need to be in full control of all.

That is your Duty! As it is, as well, to Honor My Dream!

You shall use all your tricks to conquer everything I do Express. Not because You don't wish to, but because I am everything You ever Dream about!
