<P>If you have hit this link, the white text on black backgrounds will all turn black and be invisible.  This is so that the page can be <I>printed out</I> with black text.  To read the text again on screen, the link must expire.  The browser can be instructed to expire all links immediately.  Any other links on pages where the unvisited link color is white, that one wishes to print out, must also be hit.

<P>I have noticed that Internet Explorer may print out text even if the font has been set to white, in which case visiting the links may have been unnecessary.

<P>Backspace to return to the source page.
