<P><blockquote><font size=+1>It has sometimes been asked whether God commands certain things because they are right, or whether certain things are right because God commands them.  With Hooker, and against Dr. Johnson, I emphatically embrace the first alternative.  The second might lead to the abominable conclusion (reached, I think, by Paley) that charity is good only because God arbitrarily commanded it -- that he might equally well have commanded us to hate Him and one another and that hatred would then have been right.  I believe, on the contrary, that 'they err who think that of the will of God to do this or that there is no reason besides His will' [Hooker, <I>Laws of Eccl. Polity</I>, I, i, 5].  God's will is determined by His wisdom which always perceives, and his goodness which always embraces, the instrinsically good.</font>

<P><font size=+1>Thus it is wrong to say that the content of the divine commandments is the result of the Creator's whim, and equally wrong to say that the Creator is subject to external laws, ready-made rules that exist independently of Him which it is not in His power to invalidate.  The first would question God's infinite wisdom, the second His omnipotence.</font>

<P>A major element, perhaps the principal element, of historical religions are explanations about the ultimate, transcendent constituents of reality.  Other issues, like the Problem of Evil, are explained in such terms:  e.g. God's purposes and plans for the universe and our own fate after death.

<P>Immanuel Kant's Antinomies, from the <I>Critique of Pure Reason</I>, are contradictions that he believed follow necessarily from our attempts to conceive the nature of transcendent reality.  Kant thought that certain of his Antinomies (God and Freedom) could be resolved as "Postulates of Practical Reason."  Here the view is that the Antinomies <I>cannot</I> be resolved and that attempts to conceive the transcendent will always produce irresolvable contradictions.  This does not mean that there is no transcendent or that attempts to conceive the transcendent are meaningless.  They are, just as Kant said, necessitated by reason itself.  It does mean, however, that the transcendent defeats rational representation.

<P>What follows are Kant's four Antinomies, omitting Kant's lengthy proofs for each, and six more possible Antinomies relevant to other transcendent objects, theology, and the Problem of Evil, with brief arguments:

If what God does or allows to happen does not <I>appear</I> to be good to us, it is meaningless for us to reproach God with it, since, even if we think we are not mistaken about what <I>is</I> good, the good is no standard independent of God to compare with God's actions.

God is the creator of everything, including all the standards of value.  It is consequently meaningless to question the goodness of God, and praising God for His goodness is redundant and superfluous. [Compare, <a href="#text-6">Ninth Antinomy</a>]</td></tr>

<P>The "solution" to Antinomies is that we <I>cannot know</I> how to resolve them.  We must suspend judgment in the matter.  This was the recommendation of the Greek Skeptic <a href="hist-1.htm#hellen">Pyrrho of Elis</a> (<I>Pyrrh&ocirc;n &Ecirc;le&icirc;os</I>), who did not believe that any knowledge, about anything, was possible.  This solution for the Problem of Evil and knowledge of transcendent objects, therefore, I would call, on the pattern of Kant's "Transcendental Idealism" (where most people have no idea what Kant meant by "idealism"), "Transcendental Pyrrhonism."

<P>A full bodied "Transcendental Pyrrhonism" would be that we cannot know whether or not there is a God, whether or not there is a soul, whether or not there is really freedom, whether or not there is immortality, whether or not there is a purpose to the world, whether or not suffering has meaning, whether or not life has meaning, and whether God has a benevolent or an absolutely free and arbitrary will.  This is stronger that the traditional viewpoint of Buddhism, which does assert that there is no soul (&acirc;tman) and that there is no God (Brahman), even though the Buddha himself simply refused to "elucidate" these things and even though we might expect the Four-Fold Negation to be applied to the soul and God as much as to other things.  And, of course, the Buddha did assert the meaningfulness of life through the achievement of Nirv&acirc;n.a.

<P>Curiously, Pyrrho of Elis may have derived inspiration directly from the Four-Fold Negation itself, for Pyrrho had traveled to India with his teacher Anaxarchus in the army of Alexander the Great, "with the result that he even associated with the Naked Philosophers (<I>Gymnosophista&iacute;</I>) in India and with the Magi (<I>M&aacute;gois</I>)" [Diogenes Laertius].  The most striking sign of this possible influence is how Pyrrho expressed himself in the actual form of the Four-Fold Negation:  "...but we should be unopinionated, uncommitted, and unwavering, saying concerning each individual thing that it no more is than is not, or it both is and is not, or it neither is nor is not" [Aristocles].  The entire tradition of Hellenistic skepticism may thus have Buddhist roots.  And since the Hellenistic Academic Skeptics based their skepticism on the idea that equally good arguments can be offered for any thesis, which is the form of Kant's Antinomies, we might even say that Kant's own doctrine owes something to Buddhist influence.

<P>We might ask about "Transcendental Pyrrhonism," "How can we live like this?"  Of course, having accepted any <I>particular</I> religion, one does not need to live like this.  Having rejected all religion, one may also live on any terms that one may have accepted.  On the other hand, living with "Transcendental Pyrrhonism" might mean that one must live <I>as though</I> there is a God, who is watching over us, and <I>as though</I> there is not, which leaves us on our own.  This might seem rather difficult.  Living <I>as though</I> we were immortal and <I>as though</I> we were not might be clearer, since the former requires us to plan for the future, while the latter requires us to value the day as though there is no tomorrow.  <I>Both</I> attitudes, indeed, seem to address the human condition.  We should devalue neither the day nor the future.  Similarly, we might think that it is only up to us to testify to what is right and good and beautiful, doing what is right for its own sake, even as we <I>hope</I> that some ultimate remedy awaits wrongs and evils that we cannot address.  Kant asked "What can we hope?"  But "hope" is not the word to use if we were to <I>know</I> what the future holds, or does not hold.  To <I>hope</I> is to confess our ignorance.

<P>Compare:  "These theories which The Blessed One [The Buddha] has left unelucidated, has set aside and rejected,--that the world is eternal, that the world is not eternal, that the world is finite, that the world is infinite..." from the Majjhima-Nik&acirc;ya, Sutta 63, in <I>Buddhism in Translations</I>, by Henry Clarke Warren, Atheneum, 1987.

<P>The interpretation of this in Buddhism may be either, (1) that the question whether the world is finite or infinite is unimportant, "unefidying," and so may be disregarded, or (2) that the question <B>cannot</B> be answered because in the nature of things it is undecidable.  The Kantian interpretation, of course, as well as most historical Buddhist interpretation, is for the latter.

<P>The issue here is whether matter is infinitely divisible.  The "simple" would be an <I>atom</I>, which cannot be divided further.  Modern atoms, of course, can be divided, but then they consist of sub-atomic particles, which do appear to be "simple."  <I>If</I> Kant's argument against simple parts is based on the divisibility of space, it fails for modern elementary sub-atomic particles (quarks and leptons), which, as Dirac Point Particles, do not have any spatial extension and so are not spatially divisible.  On the other hand, sub-atomic particles have other kinds of "parts"--charge, mass, lepton number, baryon number, strangeness, etc.--and the interaction of these means that particles can change into other kinds of particles.  "Simple" had always implied <B>indestructible</B> in ancient and mediaeval metaphysics.  Only mass-energy (E=mc<sup>2</sup>), in whatever form, may now be regarded as indestructible.

<P>Compare:  "These theories which The Blessed One [The Buddha] has left unelucidated, has set aside and rejected...that the soul and the body are identical, that the soul is one thing and the body another, that the saint exists after death, that the saint does not exist after death, that the saint both exists and does not exist after death, that the saint neither exists nor does not exist after death..." from the Majjhima-Nik&acirc;ya, Sutta 63, <I>op. cit</I>.

<P>This would be another "unedifying" issue for Buddhism.  Its undecidability has less the moral dimension of the arguments of the Antinomy than the metaphysical one of whether the "saint exists after death."  If the saint <B>cannot</B> be said either to exist or not or both or neither, then this is conformable to the Kantian point about the impossibility of a consistent metaphysical theory of transcendent objects, like souls.

<P>The Antinomy of Purpose could be called the "Forrest Gump" Antinomy, since, at the end of the 1995 movie <I>Forrest Gump</I>, the title character, Forrest Gump, asks whether things happen because of "destiny," i.e. a purpose, or because everything is just floating around "accidental like," i.e. purposeless.  He concludes that it is "both," which is a suitably paradoxical take on it and at least the beginning of a Pyrrhonian or Buddhist approach.

<P>The idea of the Antinomy of Theodicy was inspired by a comment from <B>Leora Batnitzky</B>, currently in the Religion Department at <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~religion/people.html">Princeton University</a>.  At a dissertation defense on <a href="leibniz.htm">Leibniz</a>, Dr. Batnistzky commented that there seemed to be <a href="century.htm">two kinds of people</a>, those who are <B>comforted</B> by Theodicy, and those who are <B>offended</B> by it.  The former would certainly agree with the Thesis of the Antinomy; the latter might tend to agree with the Anti-Thesis.
