THE "SIX SCHOOLS" OF INDIAN PHILOSOPHY</H2>

<P><center><img src="images/key-8.gif"></center>

<P><a name="text-0"><I><B>&#x1e62;a&#x1e0d;dar&#x015b;ana</B></I>, <img src="images/greek/school10.gif" align=middle>, the "Six Schools" or "Six Doctrines" of "orthodox" Indian philosophy are the schools that accept the authority of the Vedas and thus religiously are considered part of Hinduism [<a href="#note-0">note</a>].  Accepting the authority of the Vedas, however, does not mean actually using them.  M&icirc;m&acirc;&#x1e41;s&acirc; and Ved&acirc;nta are specifically the schools of interpretation of the Vedas; the other four are based on independent reasoning.  "Heterodox" schools, which reject the authority of the Vedas, are found in separate religions, like Buddhism and Jainism, or with the rare, reviled "materialists," whose own texts have all been lost.  The treatment follows P.T. Raju's <I>The Philosophical Traditions of India</I> [University of Pittsburgh Press, 1971, p.35].

<li> <a name="mimamsa"><I><B>M&icirc;m&acirc;&#x1e41;s&acirc;</B></I>, <img src="images/greek/school02.gif" align=middle>, "Interpretation," or <I>P&ucirc;rva M&icirc;m&acirc;&#x1e41;s&acirc;</I>, <img src="images/greek/school03.gif" align=middle>, "Prior Interpretation," the School of Interpretation of the <I>Karmak&acirc;&#x1e47;&#x1e0d;a</I>, the "action part," or first half, of the Vedas.  M&icirc;m&acirc;&#x1e41;s&acirc; originates fairly early, perhaps the 2nd century BC, since it is no more than a extension of the task of explaining the <a href="upan.htm#veda">Vedas</a>, a project that started in the Vedas themselves with the Br&acirc;hma&#x1e47;as.  The doctrine of the eternity of the Vedas was argued by this school, and the theory of <a href="karma.htm">karma</a> may have originated here; but it mostly confined itself to promoting the sanctity and power of the Vedas.  The school later was practically absorbed into Ved&acirc;nta.<P>

<li><a name="vedanta"><I><B>Ved&acirc;nta</B></I>, <img src="images/greek/school04.gif" align=middle>, "End of the Vedas," or</a> the <I>Uttara M&icirc;m&acirc;&#x1e41;s&acirc;</I>, <img src="images/greek/school05.gif" align=middle>, "Posterior Interpretation," the School of Interpretation of the <I>J&ntilde;anak&acirc;&#x1e47;&#x1e0d;a</I>, the "knowledge part," or second half, of the Vedas, i.e. the Forest Treatises and especially the <a href="upan.htm#upan"><I>Upani&#x1e63;ads</I></a>.  Ved&acirc;nta starts relatively late, since it picks up where the Upani&#x1e63;ads leave off, and there may be Upani&#x1e63;ads as late as 200 AD.  Ved&acirc;nta then sets down to interpret its fundamental texts, which include the Upani&#x1e63;ads, the <a href="gita.htm">Bhagavad G&icirc;ta</a>, and the <I>Brahma S&ucirc;tras</I> of B&acirc;dar&acirc;ya&#x1e47;a.   The <I>Brahma S&ucirc;tras</I> were themselves written in the 1st or 2nd century AD and might be regarded as the first document of Ved&acirc;nta itself.  It is worth noting that the influence of <a href="buddhism.htm">Buddhism</a> still seems very strong in the classic expression of <I>Advaita Ved&acirc;nta</I> in <B>Sh&atilde;nkara</B> (c.788-820 AD).  Later forms of Ved&acirc;nta became steadily more theistic and dualistic and thus approximated to Isl&acirc;m rather than to Buddhism.

<P>The fundamental division in Ved&acirc;nta is whether Brahman and the &Acirc;tman are identical or different.  If they are identical, we have a school of <img src="images/greek/advaita.gif" align=middle><img src="images/greek/school04.gif" align=middle>, Advaita or "non-dual" Ved&acirc;nta.  A "non-dual" doctrine can also be called "Monism," that there is only one thing.  If Brahman and the &Acirc;tman are different, we have a school of <img src="images/greek/dvaita.gif" align=middle><img src="images/greek/school04.gif" align=middle>, Dvaita or "dualistic" Ved&acirc;nta.  The Dvaita Ved&acirc;nta of <B>Madhva</B> (1238–1317 AD) is a Theistic doctrine of a personal God, with the "five differences":  &nbsp;that (1) Brahman is different from &Acirc;tmans, (2) Brahman is different from matter, (3) &Acirc;tmans are different from each other, (4) &Acirc;tmans are different from matter, and (5) pieces of matter are different from each other.  Thus, it is a pluralistic metaphysics, not just dualistic.

<P>In the "qualified" Advaita Ved&acirc;nta of <B>Ramanuja</B> (1017–1137 AD), Brahman is a personal God, who nevertheless contains all reality, including multiple selves and the world.  This may be called a "Pantheism" and is comparable to the metaphysics of <a href="spinoza.htm">Baruch Spinoza</a>.  The God of both Madhva and Ramanuja is identified as the devotionalistic deity <a href="gods.htm">Vi&#x1e63;&#x1e47;u</a>.

<P>In the "unqualified" Advaita Ved&acirc;nta of Sh&atilde;nkara, Brahman is the only thing that exists, and the world and individual selves are part of illusion, <I>M&acirc;ya</I>, <img src="images/greek/maya.gif" align=middle> (which is not illusion, but the creative power of God, for Theistic or other realistic versions of Vedanta).  Since the &Acirc;tman, identical to Brahman, is not an individual self or soul, individuality over time and from life to life must be carried by the "subtle" bodies that are examined in the <a href="upan.htm#manduk">M&acirc;&#x1e47;&#x1e0d;&ucirc;kya Upani&#x1e63;ad</a>.  Brahman is left without much in the way of positive characteristics, much like the "One" of Being in <a href="greek.htm#parmenides">Parmenides</a>.  But there are three essential attributes of Brahman that are expressed in the formula, <img src="images/greek/saccidan.gif" align=middle>, <B>Saccid&acirc;nanda</B>.

<P>First is <img src="images/greek/sat.gif" align=middle>, <I>sat</I>, which is "existence."  This is the same root as <img src="images/greek/satya.gif" align=middle>, <I>satya</I>, "truth," which turns up in the <I>Saty&acirc;graha</I>, <img src="images/greek/satyagra.gif" align=middle>, or "Truth Force" of <a href="gandhi.htm">Mah&acirc;tm&acirc; Gandhi</a>.  Second is <img src="images/greek/cit.gif" align=middle>, <I>cit</I>, which is consciousness.  This diverges from the characterization of Being by Parmenides, who left the existence of both consciousness and the world unexplained.  Here, the world, even as illusion, can exist as a representation within the consciousness of Brahman.   Third and finally there is <img src="images/greek/ananda.gif" align=middle>, <I>&acirc;nanda</I>, which is "<a href="bliss.htm">bliss</a>."  "&Acirc;nanda" was also the name of the Buddha's personal attendant, who figures in many stories about the Buddha.  Brahman is existence, consciousness, and bliss.  The ultimate Self within each of us, the &Acirc;tman, is this also.  So we do exist, and our consciousness is the consciousness of Brahman.<P>

<li><a name="sankhya"><I><B>S&acirc;nkhya</B></I></a>, <img src="images/greek/school06.gif" align=middle>, "Counting, Reckoning, Reasoning, Knowledge," the School of Theoretical Knowledge.  S&acirc;nkhya may well be the oldest school independent of the Vedas, growing up contemporaneously with the Upani&#x1e63;ads themselves.  It is argued by some that the <I>Bhagavad G&icirc;ta</I> was originally a popular exposition of the doctrine of the S&acirc;nkhya School, although the text is later dominated by theistic and devotionalistic additions.  For our purposes, the salient features of S&acirc;nkhya doctrine are the theory of the <a href="elements.htm#india"><I>gu&#x1e47;as</I></a>, <img src="images/greek/guna.gif" align=middle>, which was later accepted by all orthodox philosophy, and the principle that the self (or soul, the <I>&acirc;tman</I> or, <img src="images/yoga.gif" align=right>in S&acirc;nkhya terminology, the <I>puru&#x1e63;a</I>) neither affects nor is affected by the world of nature (called <I>prakr.ti</I> in S&acirc;nkhya terminology).  S&acirc;nkhya was originally atheistic, with an infinite number of souls, like Jainism.  In the <a href="gita.htm">G&icirc;ta</a> we see the role of S&acirc;nkhya changing from the theoretical counterpart to Yoga (in Chapter 2) to an independent yoga in its own right, <I>j&ntilde;anayoga</I> (in Chapter 3).  J&ntilde;anayoga in effect becomes simply Yoga, as follows; and historically the role of S&acirc;nkhya as the theoretical counterpart to Yoga is effectively taken over by Ved&acirc;nta.<P>

<li> <a name="yoga"><I><B>Yoga</B></I>, <img src="images/greek/school07.gif" align=middle>, "Yoking, Vehicle, Equipment, Discipline," the School of the Discipline of Achieving Liberation.  The Yoga School is to be carefully distinguished from disciplines that are <I>yogas</I> in the general sense of the word <I>yoga</I>, which is <B>any means of achieving salvation</B>, or a major elements of such means.  Thus, there are the three yogas of the Bhagavad G&icirc;ta (<I>j&ntilde;&acirc;nayoga</I>, <img src="images/greek/yoga-1.gif" align=middle>, <I>karmayoga</I>, <img src="images/greek/yoga-2.gif" align=middle>, <I>bhaktiyoga</I>, <img src="images/greek/yoga-3.gif" align=middle>), which are meant as classifications of all yogas, and also various yogas that are usually part of some higher order yoga:  <I>dhy&acirc;nayoga</I> (<img src="images/greek/yoga-4.gif" align=middle>), meditation (mentioned in the G&icirc;ta); <I>ha&#x1e6d;hayoga</I>, yogic exercises; <I>pr&acirc;&#x1e47;ayoga</I>, yogic breathing; <I>au&#x1e63;adhayoga</I>, taking drugs (not a common or esteemed method); <I>mantrayoga</I>, chanting sacred words or phrases; <I>layayoga</I>, the yoga of "dissolution"; etc.  <I>Tantrism</I> employs sexual practices for yogic purposes.  The method of the Yoga School in particular is sometimes called <I>R&acirc;jayoga</I> (<img src="images/greek/yoga-5.gif" align=middle>), the "royal yoga."  The Yoga School based its practice on the doctrine of the S&acirc;nkhya School, and the aim of its methods (<I>ha&#x1e6d;hayoga</I>, etc.) was to quiet <I>prakr.ti</I>, nature as it exists in the body, so that, like a calm body of water, the body can reflect the true remote and detached nature of the <I>puru&#x1e63;a</I>, effecting liberation.  The definitive and most famous statement of Yoga doctrine was in the <I>Yoga S&ucirc;tras</I> of <B>Pata&ntilde;jali</B>, perhaps in the 2nd century BC.  Pata&ntilde;jali added a personal God to S&acirc;nkhya doctrine; but the system is not devotionalistic, and the God exists only as an exemplar of detachment, not as an active or creative Deity after the manner of Vi&#x1e63;&#x1e47;u or Shiva.<P>

<li> <a name="nyaya"><I><B>Ny&acirc;ya</B></I>, <img src="images/greek/school08.gif" align=middle>, "Analysis," the School of Logic, and

<li> <a name="vaisheshika"><I><B>Vai&#x015b;e&#x1e63;ika</B></I>, <img src="images/greek/school09.gif" align=middle>, "Individual Characteristics," the School of Pluralistic Metaphysics, are closely related minor schools.  The relation of the doctrine of these schools to salvation is obscure and secondary.  They concerned themselves much more with abstract issues of logic, epistemology, and metaphysics.  Vai&#x015b;e&#x1e63;ika in particular held that reality was an infinite number of atom-like entities, although these were then distinct from souls.  This pluralism is similar to the teaching of two early schools of Buddhist philosophy, the <I>Sautr&acirc;ntikas</I> and <I>Vaibh&acirc;&#x1e63;ikas</I>, who held that reality consists of an infinite number of momentary entities, the <I>dharmas</I>.

<P>I expected that <I><B>&#x1e62;a&#x1e0d;dar&#x015b;ana</B></I> would be written in the <a href="cognates.htm#sanskrit">Devanagari syllabary</a> with a ligature combination for the retroflex <B>d</B> (<B>&#x1e0d;</B>) and the dental <B>d</B>.  Given the regularities of such combinations, the word might look like this:  &nbsp;<img src="images/greek/school01.gif" align=middle>.  However, neither my wife nor I have been able to find such a ligature ever used.  As is common in Hindi, Sanskrit in this case seems to write the two letters separately, with the <I>vir&acirc;ma</I> diacritic under the first to show that it is used without a vowel, thus:  &nbsp;<img src="images/greek/school10.gif" align=middle>.

<P>More substantively, "philosophy" itself in Sanskrit is <img src="images/greek/philosin.gif" align=middle><img src="images/greek/shastra.gif" align=middle>, <I>dar&#x015b;ana-&#x015b;&acirc;stra</I>, where <img src="images/greek/philosin.gif" align=middle>, <I>dar&#x015b;ana</I>, is "seeing, appearance, view," or "thought, doctrine," and <img src="images/greek/shastra.gif" align=middle>, <I>&#x015b;&acirc;stra</I>, is "system, science" or "teaching."  Thus, <img src="images/greek/dharma.gif" align=middle><img src="images/greek/shastra.gif" align=middle>, <I>dharma-&#x015b;&acirc;stra</I>, is a law code, a doctrine of <a href="caste.htm"><I>dharma</I></a> or "duty."  Another word for "philosophy" is found in Hindi, <img src="images/greek/philosi2.gif" align=middle>.  This is actually read <img src="images/greek/philosi3.gif" align=middle>, <I>falsaf&acirc;</I>; and it clearly is not borrowed from English or <a href="greek.htm">Greek</a>, but from <a href="hist-1.htm#islam">Arabic</a> <img src="images/greek/falsafah.gif">, <I>falsafah</I>.

THE "SIX SCHOOLS" OF CHINESE PHILOSOPHY</H2>

<p><center><img src="images/key-c1.gif"></center>

<P>The tradition was that there were a "Hundred Schools" of philosophy that grew up during the <a href="sangoku.htm#sp&au">Spring and Autumn Period</a> (722-481) of the <a href="sangoku.htm#chou">Chou</a> (Zhou) Dynasty (1027-256 BC).  Later in the <a href="sangoku.htm#han">Former H&agrave;n</a> Dynasty (206-25 AD), the historian Szu-ma Ch'ien [Sima Qian] (145-86 BC), in the <I>Shih Chi</I>, <img src="images/hiero/shiji.gif" align=middle>, "Historical Records," the first great systematic Chinese history, identified "Six Schools," <I>Liu Chia</I>, <img src="images/hiero/sch-6.gif" align=middle> (or <I>Liu Chiao</I>, <img src="images/hiero/six.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/school2.gif" align=middle>).  For these, the treatment below follows Fung Yu-lan's <I>A Short History of Chinese Philosophy</I> [Free Press, 1948, 1966, pp. 30-31].

<P>The Chinese term for philosophy itself is <img src="images/hiero/philos2.gif" align=middle>, consisting of <img src="images/hiero/wise.gif" align=middle>, "wise," and <img src="images/hiero/study.gif" align=middle>, "study."  It is not clear to me if this is an ancient or a modern usage.  A route along a canal in <a href="sangoku.htm#heian">Ky&ocirc;to</a>, where one of the Ky&ocirc;to School philosophers, Nishida Kitaro (1870-1945), used to stroll, is now called the <img src="images/hiero/philos2.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/no.gif" align=middle><img src="images/dao2.gif" align=middle>, <I>Tetsugaku-no-michi</I> in Japanese, the "Philosopher's Walk" (literally, "Philosophy Way" or "Way of Philosophy").  This identification was probably suggested by the famous daily walk (<I>Philosophenweg</I>) that <a href="kant.htm">Immanuel Kant</a> took in <a href="outremer.htm#teutonic">K&ouml;nigsberg</a>.  "Philosopher" itself is <img src="images/hiero/philos2.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/school1.gif" align=middle>, <I>Ch&ecirc;-hs&uuml;eh-chia</I> [Wade-Giles].

<P>  While Fung Yu-lan was clearly using <img src="images/hiero/school1.gif" align=middle> to mean "school," I was originally perplexed that this meaning was not immediately evident in <I>Mathews' Chinese-English Dictionary</I> [Harvard University Press, 1972, character #594, p.79], where the primary meaning is "a house, family, a home, relatives" (rather tellingly composed of a pig under roof, which we can imagine made for a prosperous home in much of rural China).  However, a secondary meaning, "a suffix to indicate the agent... a specialist in any branch" (as used for "philosopher" above), includes the buried definition "a class or school."  This is much clearer in the <I>ABC Chinese-English Comprehensive Dictionary</I>, edited by John DeFrancis [University of Hawai'i Press, 2003, p.408], where the second definition is "school of thought."  At the same time, Mathews defines <img src="images/hiero/school2.gif" align=middle> [character #719, p.98] as "to teach, instruct," and "a sect, religions, doctrines," which may apply better to Confucianism and Taoism than to the other schools of philosophy.  As seen below, in the expansion of the "six schools" to nine, the different meanings of the first character give rise to some ambiguity or confusion in the tradition.

<ol>
<li><a name="confucian"><img src="images/kongfuzi.gif" align=right> <I><B>Ju Chia</B></I> [<img src="images/hiero/sch-lit.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/school1.gif" align=middle>], <a name="text-1">School of the Literati, Confucianism</a>.  <a href="confuci.htm"><B>Confucius</B></a>, K'ung-fu-tzu, <img src="images/hiero/kongfuzi.gif" align=middle>, (551-479 BC) becomes, long after his death, the dominant Chinese philosopher both morally and politically.  <B>Mencius</B> (Meng Tzu) (c.390-305 BC) extends and systematizes Confucius's ideas; but, with Confucius's adoption in the <a href="sangoku.htm#han">H&agrave;n</a> Dynasty as the official moral and political doctrine of the State, the Confucian tradition became so broad that "<a href="key.htm#class">Scholar</a>," <img src="images/hiero/four-sch.gif" align=middle>, or "Literatus," <img src="images/hiero/sch-lit.gif" align=middle>, became all but synonymous with "Confucian."  And as one of the "Three Ways" (<img src="images/hiero/way-3.gif" align=middle>), together with Taoism and Buddhism, Confucianism grew into one of the traditional religions of the H&agrave;n Chinese [<a href="#note-1">1</a>].  Confucius himself had a simple moral and political teaching:  to love others; to honor one's parents; to do what is right instead of what is of advantage; to practice "reciprocity," "don't do to others what you would not want yourself"; to rule by moral example instead of by force and violence; and so forth.  Confucius thought that a ruler who had to resort to force had already failed as a ruler.  This was not a principle that Chinese rulers always obeyed, but it was the ideal of benevolent rule.  During the <a href="sangoku.htm#t'ang">T'ang</a> Dynasty, the canon of <a href="confuci.htm#classics">Confucian Classics</a> became the basis for the great <a href="confuci.htm#note-8">civil service examinations</a> that henceforth provided the magistrates and bureaucrats for the Chinese government.  This system is still impressive, but it was not always to good effect.  The founder of the <a href="sangoku.htm#ming">M&iacute;ng</a> Dynasty (1368-1644) <B>Chu Y&uuml;an-chang</B>, an illiterate peasant who rose to expel the Mongols and win the throne, was suspicious of the influence of the scholars.  He tried to balance the scholarly with the military establishment so that the scholars would not dominate the government.  <img src="images/yuan.gif" align=left>Later, when the Chinese sent Admiral <B>Ch&ecirc;ng Ho</B> [<I>Zheng He</I>], a Moslem eunuch who started out as a war prisoner slave, on seven great <a href="sangoku.htm#admiralhe"><img src="images/mingship.gif" align=right border=0>naval expeditions</a> into the Indian Ocean between 1405 and 1433, it was the scholars who powerfully opposed engaging in anything so lowly as trade and dealing with such uncivilized barbarians.  The expeditions, indeed, visited not only <a href="islam.htm#malacca">Indonesia</a> and <a href="sangoku.htm#sayyids">India</a>, but penetrated into the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea, and far down the east coast of Africa.  The fleets were large, heavily manned, well armed, and contained, reportedly, ships of nine masts that were more than 400 feet long.  But when the court faction of the scholars triumphed and ended the expeditions, they also destroyed their records and made it a capital offense to build anything larger than a two-masted ship.  This crippled Chinese trade and foreign involvement; and one is left to wonder just how world history would have been different had Vasco da Gama arrived in the Indian Ocean in 1498, just 65 years later, to discover an overwhelming and technologically equal or superior Chinese naval presence.  In China itself, the scholars indeed went on to dominate the government and tip the balance against the military, which left the country so unprepared that in 1644 the forces of Manchuria were allowed in to deal with a rebellion.  The Manchus took advantage of this to take over the country; and so the final Chinese Dynasty, the <a href="sangoku.htm#ch'ing">Ch'ing</a> [<I>Qing</I>] (1644-1912), wasn't Chinese at all.  This was probably not what the scholars would have wanted, but they had certainly brought it about.  Curiously, the Ch'ing adopted scholarly sensibilities and retained Ming naval and maritime policy xenophobia.  This left China once again helpless when forces technologically superior to the <a href="newspain.htm">Portuguese</a>, especially the British, eventually arrived, irresistibly pressing for commercial access to the country.  The scholars never did adapt, and the examination system was eventually abolished rather than modernized.

<P><a href="confuci.htm#classics">Confucian Classics</a><p>

<li><a name="tao"><img src="images/dao.gif" align=right> <I><B>Tao-Te Chia</B></I> [<img src="images/hiero/sch-tao.gif" align=middle>], Taoism.  The philosophical beginnings of Taoism in the <a href="taote.htm"><I>Tao Te Ching</I></a>, reputedly by the sage <B>Lao Tzu</B>, <img src="images/hiero/laozi.gif" align=middle>, and the <I>Chuang Tzu</I> -- named after <B>Chuang Tzu</B> [<I>Zhuangzi</I>], c. 369-c.286 BC -- led to the great alternative to Confucianism in Chinese culture.  The <B><I>Tao</I></B> is the "Way," both as a course of action (what everyone else, like Confucius, meant by it) and a hidden Force that is responsible for the Order of Nature, if, that is, we do not disrupt things by our own attempts at control.  Although Taoism begins with considerable political advice, it ends up primarily dealing with art, beauty, and nature.  Even Confucians, who otherwise concern themselves with moral and political discourse, could adopt a Taoist side through appreciation of nature and of arts like calligraphy.  The proper Taoist sage, however, wanders the highways or lives in the mountains or forests <img src="images/sage.gif" align=left>alone -- the <img src="images/hiero/mountain.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/forest.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/hidden.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/withdraw.gif" align=middle>, "mountain and forest hermit" -- answering only in riddles questions put to him.  This preference for the <I>rural</I>, individual, and paradoxical was certainly a factor in Taoist political advice not being taken very seriously.  In this, they look like the Chinese equivalent of the <a href="hist-1.htm#cynic">Cynics</a> in Greek philosophy.  A Taoist Sage would never put himself forward, which is why it is probable that Lao Tzu, the "Old Master," despite legends about him meeting Confucius, did not exist. A true Taoist might think it too much to put his name on a book -- although, of course, later many did.

<P>At left we see the Taoist mendicant "Master Gourd" from Robert van Gulik's <a href="ross/dee.htm">Judge Dee</a> story, <I>Necklace and Calabash</I> [1967].  Although the stereotype of the Taoist Sage is an asocial recluse, wanderer, and hermit, there is nevertheless the tradition that such person may nevertheless be the wisest in practical, including military, matters.  A striking example of this is in <I>The Romance of the Three Kingdoms</I>, <img src="images/hiero/three.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/kingdom.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/practice.gif" align=middle><img src="images/yi2.gif" align=middle>, where Liu Pei (<I>Liu Bei</I>), who would become the first Emperor of the <a href="sangoku.htm#three">Shu Han</a> dynasty, seeks out the Taoist recluse Chu-ke Liang (<I>Zhuge Liang</I>), known as K'ung-ming (<I>Kongming</I>).  Liu Pei travels three times to find and petition K'ung-ming before obtaining his services.  Then K'ung-ming serves the Dynasty with superior administrative, diplomatic, strategic, and tactical abilities.  Thus, while the prevalent political ideas of classical China are Confucian, there is the suspicion that the Taoists may know more about the way things work -- including magical abilities, which K'ung-ming also uses occasionally.  Even Master Gourd of the Judge Dee story turns out to be involved in high level Chinese politics.

<P>We see a bit of overlap again between Confucians and Taoists in the expression <img src="images/hiero/hidden.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/withdraw.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/zhi2.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/four-sch.gif" align=middle>, "retired scholar."  We have seen <img src="images/hiero/hidden.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/withdraw.gif" align=middle>, "hidden, withdrawn," above for the Taoist hermit.  But when attributed to a scholar, <img src="images/hiero/four-sch.gif" align=middle>, it is simply "retirement."  The retired Confucian, indeed, free of public office, becomes much more like a Taoist, although probably not wandering the highways or becoming a recluse in the mountains or forests.

<P>Later Taoism grew into one of the three classical religions of China (the "Three Ways"), picking up many popular, especially magical beliefs (things like Chinese geomancy, <img src="images/hiero/wind.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/water2.gif" align=middle>, the art of discovering auspicious positions and orientations for homes, furniture, businesses, graves, etc.), monastic practices from Buddhism (to the disgust of Confucians), and especially a body of alchemical research whose purpose was to bring about immortality.  Taoists thus worshipped a group of <a href="elements.htm#gods">deities</a>, the "Immortals," who were supposed to dwell on distant blessed islands.  This desire for <I>unnatural</I> life extension seems to contradict the original thrust of philosophical Taoism, to allow Nature to take its course.  The idea that mercury, because it preserved bodies so well in embalming (and there are some spectacular mummies found by Chinese archaeology), would be part of an elixir of immortality led to many deaths, including perhaps that of <a href="sangoku.htm#ch'in">Shih-huang-ti</a> himself, from mercury poisoning.

<P>The Classics of Taoism are less entensive and less organized than those of Confucianism.  Although Taoism counts as one of the Three Ways and thus is in one sense the equal of Confucianism and <a href="buddhism.htm">Buddhism</a>, its books were not used for the <a href="confuci.htm#note-8">civil service examinations</a> and so are more of the status of the texts of other schools of philosophy than of the Confucian Classics.

<P><ol>
<li>The <a href="taote.htm"><I>Tao Te Ching</I></a>, of Lao Tzu [<I>Laozi</I>], the legendary and probably composite sage.

<li>The <I>Chuang Tzu</I>, named for its author [<I>Zhuangzi</I>].

<li><I>The Classic of Simplicity and Emptiness</I>, <I>Ch'ung-hsu Chen-ching</I> [<I>Chongxu zhenjing</I>], by Lieh Tzu [<I>Liezi</I>], or just the <I>Lieh Tzu</I>.  An early but possibly derivative work, dependant on the <I>Tao Te Ching</I> and <I>Chuang Tzu</I>.

<li>The <I>Treasury of the Tao</I>, <I>Tao Tsang</I> or <I>Tao Tsang Ching</I>, <img src="images/dao2.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/treasur2.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/classic.gif" align=middle> [<I>Daozang</I>, although I've cited the "treasury" character with its alternative pronuniciation, <I>Tao Ts'ang</I>].  This is a large and much later compilation, c.400 AD, and is thus not one of the core Classics of Taoism, but is often accorded that dignity in its name.  Additions were subsequently made in the T'ang, Sung, and Ming Dynasties.

<li><I>The T'ai Shang Tractate of Actions and Their Retributions</I>, <I>T'ai-Shang Kan-Ying P'ien</I> [<I>Taishang Ganying Pian</I>, "Treatise of the Exalted One on Response and Recompense"].  This is included by James Legge (1815-1897) in "The Sacred Books of the East" series, Volume XL, <I>The Texts of T&acirc;oism</I>, Part II [Oxford 1891, Dover 1962], along with several short works, the <I>Classic of Purity</I>, <I>Ch'ing-ching Ching</I> [<I>Qingjing Jing</I>], the <I>Classic of Harmony of the Seen and Unseen</I>, <I>Yin-fu Ching</I> [<I>Yinfujing</I>], the <I>Classic of the Pivot of Jade</I>, <I>Y&uuml;-shu Ching</I> [<I>Yushu Jing</I>], and the <I>Classic of the Directory for the Day</I>, <I>Nei Jih-yung Ching</I> [<I>Nei Riyong Jing</I>].  I believe that these all can be found in versions of the <I>Tao Tsang</I> and are thus similarly late in provenance.</ol><p>

<li><a name="yinyang"> <I><B>Yin-Yang Chia</B></I> [<img src="images/hiero/sch-yin.gif" align=middle>], the Ying-Yang School, or the "Cosmologists," where the theory of the fundamental opposites, <a href="yinyang.htm"><I>yin</I> and <I>yang</I></a>, <img src="images/hiero/yin.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/yang.gif" align=middle>, was developed.  Like the theory of the <a href="elements.htm#india"><I>gun.as</I></a> in India, the theory of <I>y&iacute;n</I> and <I>yang</I> was eventually adopted in all Chinese thought, and the Yin-Yang School ceased to be a separate entity (if it ever had been).  But the Cosmologist philosopher <B>Tsou Yen</B> is reported to have developed the original Chinese theory of the <a href="elements.htm#china">five elements</a>.  This School is sometimes also called the School of Divination because of the use of the <I>I Ching</I> [<img src="images/hiero/yijing.gif" align=middle>], which embodies Yin-Yang theory.<P>

<li><a name="legal"> <I><B>Fa Chia</B></I> [<img src="images/hiero/sch-leg.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/school1.gif" align=middle>], the Legalist School or School of Law [<img src="images/hiero/sch-leg.gif" align=middle>].  The Legalists rejected the Taoist and Confucian ideas that government must be based on morality and that good government must foster, in one way or another, moral dispositions in the people that will then automatically make them behave well.  The Legalists thought that government was simply a matter of laying down laws and then punishing people, mostly by execution, who did not obey them.  <a name="text-2">This school achieved great historical significance when</a> its views were adopted as official policy by the "First Emperor," Shih-huang-ti [<img src="images/emperor4.gif" align=middle>] of the <a href="sangoku.htm#ch'in">Ch'in</a> [<img src="images/hiero/qin.gif" align=middle>] Dynasty (255-207) [<a href="#note-2">2</a>].  Shih-huang-ti had a ferocious and ruthless disposition that found the advice of the Legalist philosopher <B>Li Szu</B> [<I>Li Si</I>] agreeable.  In 213, on Li Szu's urging, Shih-huang-ti outlawed all other schools of thought and began to burn their books.  This may be why more is not know about the "Hundred Schools."  Scholars who resisted the order were executed:  346 (or more) are supposed to have actually been buried alive [<a href="#note-3">3</a>].  The fall of the Ch'in Dynasty soon thereafter, which also led to the execution of Li Szu, was later seen as proof of the working of the <a href="confuci.htm#six">Mandate of Heaven</a>.

<P>The Classics of Legalism consist of several texts:

<P><ol>
<li><I>The Book of Lord Shang</I>, of Shang Yang.
<li>The <I>Kuan Tzu</I> [<I>Guanzi</I>] of Kuan Chung [<I>Guan Zhong</I>].
<li>The <I>Han-fei Tzu</I> [<I>Hanfeizi</I>], also named for its author.
<li>The <I>Shen Tzu</I> [<I>Shenzi</I>], a one chapter fragment, of Shen Pu-hai [<I>Shen Buhai</I>].
<li>The <I>Shen Tzu</I> [<I>Shenzi</I>], a seven chapter fragement, of Shen Tao [<I>Shen Dao</I>].
<li><I>The Canon of Laws</I>, of Li K'uei [<I>Li Kui</I>].
</ol><P>

<li><a name="ming"> <I><B>Ming Chia</B></I> [<img src="images/hiero/sch-name.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/school1.gif" align=middle>], School of Names, the "Debaters," "Sophists," or "Logicians."  this contains a variety of thinkers who were concerned with issues of language, logic, and meaning.  <B>Kung-sun Lung</B> (c.320-250 BC) is once supposed to have replied, when told that he could not travel on a certain road with his horse, that his horse was white and that because the rule mentioned horses and not white horses, it did not apply to him:  &nbsp;<img src="images/hiero/white.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/horse.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/fei.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/horse.gif" align=middle>, "A white horse is not a horse."  This leaves us in no doubt why some members of the School of Names can be called "<a href="why.htm">Sophists</a>."  While a white horse is indeed a horse, we might supply Kung-sun Lung with a parallel statement that is correct:  &nbsp;"New York is not York."<P>

<li><a name="mohism"> <I><B>Mo Chia</B></I> [<img src="images/hiero/sch-moh.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/school1.gif" align=middle>], School of Mo Tzu [<img src="images/hiero/sch-moh.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/zi.gif" align=middle>, or Micius] (479-381 BC), <I>Mohism</I>.  <B>Mo Tzu</B> was an early critic of Confucius.  Although Confucius teaches both righteousness (<I>y&igrave;</I>) and love (<I>r&egrave;n</I>), Mo Tzu believed there was far too much emphasis on duty and too little on love.  Mo Tzu also rejected Confucius's distant attitude towards religion.  That is somewhat ironic, since Confucianism actually <I>became</I> a religion precisely by absorbing traditional religious practices.  Mo Tzu advocated a kind of Utilitarianism, called <I>Mutual Profitableness</I>:  "Righteousness is that which yields profit...Mutual love produces mutual profit....Common good arises from loving and profiting others....God must like to see men loving and benefiting one another."  Confucius might not have rejected this himself, but his references to profit are mostly disparaging and the Confucian tradition came to strongly disapprove of profit as a motive or of its pursuit as an activity.  Even Mo Tzu did not advocate any sort of individualistic pursuit of profit.  He saw it all, like Utilitarianism itself, as a matter of producing "the greatest good for the greatest number."

<P>There is one Classic of Mohism, the <I>Mo Tzu</I> [<img src="images/hiero/sch-moh.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/zi.gif" align=middle>], named for its author.

<P><hr>

<P><a name="text-4">Szu-ma Ch'ien's classification contains the schools of historical importance but one sometimes suspects that it may also artificially construct some "schools" out of disparate doctrines and thinkers.  Nevertheless, there is a strong tradition, not only of the Six Schools, but of these together with three others, into the Nine Schools, <img src="images/hiero/nine.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/school3.gif" align=middle>.  Indeed, there is a common expression in Chinese:  &nbsp;<img src="images/hiero/three.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/school2.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/nine.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/school3.gif" align=middle>, the "Three Religions and Nine Classes," or the "Three Great Teachings and the Nine Minor Traditions."  The "Three Religions" are of course the "Three Ways" of Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism.  On the other hand, <img src="images/hiero/nine.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/school3.gif" align=middle>, the "Nine Classes," has more than one meaning, as <img src="images/hiero/school3.gif" align=middle> itself can mean "current," "class," "kind," or "set of persons."  The expression <img src="images/hiero/nine.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/school3.gif" align=middle> can mean (1) the specific Nine Schools of philosophy, or "Nine 
Traditions," given here, (2) "nine classes of literature," (3) "various religious sects and academic schools," or (4) it can mean "people in various trades," "people of all sorts," or "people of all walks of life."  This latter usage curiously is said to have a <I>derogatory</I> overtone [<a href="#note-4">4</a>].  For our purposes, <img src="images/hiero/nine.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/school3.gif" align=middle> is rendered "Nine Schools."  In various sources the Nine Schools tend to be given in a fixed order, begining with the Six Schools above and then passing into these, which use the more familiar <img src="images/hiero/school1.gif" align=middle>:<p>

<li><a name="politics"><I><B>Tsung-heng Chia</B></I> [<img src="images/hiero/sch-pol1.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/sch-pol2.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/school1.gif" align=middle>], School of the Politics or Political Strategists</a>.  This is something specific to the <a href="sangoku.htm#warring">Warring States Period</a> (<img src="images/hiero/war.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/kingdom.gif" align=middle>, 481-221 BC).  The origin of the term is of great interest.  The character <img src="images/hiero/sch-pol1.gif" align=middle> can mean "perpendicular; vertical, north-south."  The <img src="images/hiero/agree.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/sch-pol1.gif" align=middle>, "North-South Agreement," was an alliance against the <a href="choustat.htm">Ch'in</a> [<img src="images/hiero/qin.gif" align=middle>].  The final alliance, of 240 BC, against the Ch'in consisted of the <a href="key.htm#kingdoms">Six Kingdoms</a>.  The character <img src="images/hiero/sch-pol2.gif" align=middle> can mean "crosswise, horizontal, east-west."  The <img src="images/hiero/join.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/sch-pol2.gif" align=middle>, "East-West Connection," meant states that had joined with the Ch'in.  As far as political strategy went, of course, Ch'in won and the Six Kingdoms were conquered.<p>

<li><a name="electics"><I><B>Tsa Chia</B></I> [<img src="images/hiero/sch-ecle.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/school1.gif" align=middle>], School of the Eclectics or Miscellaneous Writers.  It is not clear to me whether this is a grab bag for otherwise unclassified doctrines, or whether there are Eclectics who have some kind of theory of Eclecticism.  One dictionary simply says "writers of various subjects," which sounds less like a School of Philosophy than another meaning for the "Nine Schools," that they are classifications of literature.<p>

<li><a name="agriculture"><I><B>Nung Chia</B></I> [<img src="images/hiero/sch-ag.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/school1.gif" align=middle>], School of the Agriculturists.  I cannot glean from my sources who this refers to.  The expression <img src="images/hiero/sch-ag.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/school1.gif" align=middle> can now simply mean a "peasant family."  In such terms, it fits well with the meaning of the "Nine Schools" as being classes of persons rather than Schools of philosophy.<p>
</ol>

<P>Much of the information on the "Nine Schools" is simply gleaned out of dictionaries.  These include <I>Mathews' Chinese-English Dictionary</I> [Harvard University Press, 1972], <I>ABC Chinese-English Comprehensive Dictionary</I>, edited by John DeFrancis [University of Hawai'i Press, 2003], <I>The Pinyin Chinese-English Dictonary</I>, edited by Wu Jingrong [The Commercial Press, Beijing, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, 1979, 1985], and the Japanese <I>K&ocirc;jien</I> dictionary [5th printing, Tokyo Iwanami Shoten, 1999, 2005, entry for "Ky&ucirc;ry&ucirc;," "Nine Classes"].  All these reference sources give the Nine Schools in exactly the same sequence, though often with slightly different translations.  This indicates an ultimate common source in Chinese, but that is not cited.<p>

<P>The H&agrave;n (<img src="images/han-6.gif" align=middle>) Chinese are to be contrasted, for instance, with the Hu&iacute; (<img src="images/hiero/hui.gif" align=middle>) Chinese, who are simply those who practice <a href="islam.htm">Isl&acirc;m</a>, <img src="images/hiero/islam.gif" align=middle> (i.e. the "religion of the Hu&iacute;"), which is not one of the Three Ways.  Since <I>hu&iacute;</I> can also mean "Turks" or "Uigers," Moslem Chinese obviously were thought of as the equivalent of foreigners.  Confucians originally thought of Buddhists as similarly un-Chinese; but Buddhism became so popular after the fall of the <a href="sangoku.htm#han-2">Later H&agrave;n</a> Dynasty (220 AD) that, by the time of the <a href="sangoku.htm#sui">Su&iacute;</a> (590-618) and <a href="sangoku.htm#t'ang">T'ang</a> [T&aacute;ng] (618-906), it was accepted as properly Chinese.  The Hu&iacute; are still counted as an ethnic minority, some 6,490,000 as of 1980, and in the northern province of Ningxia constitute a majority of the population.

<P>Although this usage has now lapsed, the Hu&iacute;, or Hu&iacute;hu&iacute; (<img src="images/hiero/hui.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/hui-2.gif" align=middle>), in the <a href="sangoku.htm#ming">Ming</a> dynasty meant Jews and Christians as well as Muslims.  All three groups had come down the Silk Road from Central Asia.  The original Christians in this case, of course, were the <a href="hist-1.htm#christ">Nestorians</a> who appeared at the <a href="sangoku.htm#t'ang">T'ang</a> court in 635.  Jews as well as Muslims did not eat pork.  They all used related sacred languages, like Arabic, Syriac, and Hebrew.  They claimed many of the same prophets, like Abraham, Joseph, and Moses.  To the Chinese then, although there might be some differences between these groups, they were more similar to each other than to anyone else, and very different in belief, language, and culture from the Chinese.

<P>A source on the <a href="http://www.heroic-cinema.com/index.php">Internet</a> gives this interesting breakdown of the "Nine Schools" as the "Nine Classes," or perhaps "Nine Sets of Persons," in high, middle, and low forms.  We go from exalted offices, to the respectable, to the disreputable.  Of the latter, the only one that seem positively illegal in traditional China (where brothels and procurers could be legitimate) would be a robber -- however, one might not be elligible to enter the Chinese <a href="confuci.htm#note-8">examination system</a> unless from a family that had not engaged in these "base occupations" for three generations.  This is all very different from the ancient theory of the <a href="key.htm#class">Four Classes</a>, <img src="images/hiero/four-cls.gif" align=middle>, and it hardly seems exaustive in terms of possible offices, trades, crafts, or professions.

THE "SIX SCHOOLS" OF JAPAN</H2>

<p><center><img src="images/key-g.gif"></center>

<P>The "Six Schools," <I>Rokush&ucirc;</I>, <img src="images/hiero/sch-6b.gif" align=middle>, in Japanese history are the speculative, doctrinal, and disciplinary schools of Buddhism that existed during the <a href="sangoku.htm#nara">Nara Period</a>, 710-794, when a permanent Japanese capital was first established, at Nara.  These represent a mix of speculative metaphysics from India with a couple of important Chinese schools.  The first three never really existed as distinct institutional entities and did not embody any novel religious doctrine or practice.  The treatment follows Earl Miner, Hiroko Odagiri, & Robert E. Morrell, <I>The Princeton Campanion to Classical Japanese Literature</I> [Princeton University Press, 1985, p. 369-385].  <I>Sh&ucirc;</I>, <img src="images/ancestr2.gif" align=middle>, tends to be used for <I>sects</I> of Buddhism, or religions, while the term seen <a href="#china">above</a>, <img src="images/hiero/school1.gif" align=middle>, means "household," "school," or "member of a school," as in <img src="images/hiero/sch-lit.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/school1.gif" align=middle>, <I>Juka</I> in Japanese, "Confucianism" or a "Confucianist."  <img src="images/hiero/school2.gif" align=middle>, <I>ky&ocirc;</I> in Japanese, can mean "teaching," "doctrine," "religion," etc.  "Buddhism" is thus <img src="images/hiero/sch-bu1.gif" align=middle>, with the character that is used in Chinese, or <img src="images/hiero/sch-bu2.gif" align=middle>, with the simplified character that now tends to be used in Japanese, both pronounced <I>Bukky&ocirc;</I> in Japanese.  Or "Buddhism" can be <img src="images/hiero/way-bu2.gif" align=middle>, <I>Butsud&ocirc;</I>, the "Buddha Way."  <img src="images/hiero/sch-bu3.gif" align=middle>, <I>bukka</I> or, more commonly, <I>bukke</I> in Japanese, can mean a Buddhist, or, more commonly, a Buddhist priest (i.e. Japanese monk).  The combination <img src="images/ancestr2.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/school2.gif" align=middle> by itself means "religion."

<li><a name="kusha"><I><B>Kusha Sh&ucirc;</B></I> [<img src="images/hiero/kusha.gif" align=middle>], introduced to Japan in 658.  The name (<I>Chu She</I> in Chinese) translates Sanskrit <I>Abhidharmakosa</I>.  Based on the writings of the Indian philosopher <B>Vasubandhu</B> (c.350 AD), this is the Japanese representative of the Indian <a href="buddhism.htm#stages">Theravada</a> <I>Sarv&acirc;stiv&acirc;din</I> school, which held the metaphysical doctrine that reality consists of an infinite number of real, momentary entities or <I>dharmas</I> [<img src="images/hiero/dharma.gif" align=middle>].  In India the Vaibh&acirc;s.ika subdivision held that the dharmas are directly perceived, the Sautr&acirc;ntika that they are indirectly perceived.  This ultimately was not important in Japan.  The school had been introduced in China by Paramartha in 556 AD;<P>

<li><a name="jojitsu"><I><B>J&ocirc;jitsu Sh&ucirc;</B></I> [<img src="images/hiero/jojitsu.gif" align=middle>], introduced in 625; another Theravada school which held that the dharmas don't really exist.  This was based on the writings of the Indian philosopher <B>Harivarman</B>.  This was not ultimately important in Japan either.  It had been introduced in China by Kumarajiva, best known as the translator of the <I>Lotus Sutra</I>, in 408 AD;<P>

<li><a name="sanron"><I><B>Sanron Sh&ucirc;</B></I> [<img src="images/hiero/sanron.gif" align=middle>], introduced in 625.  This is the Japanese representative of the important Indian Mah&acirc;y&acirc;na <I>M&acirc;dhyamika</I> School.  <B>Nag&acirc;rjuna</B> (c.150-c.250), perhaps the greatest Buddhist philosopher in India, held that the dharmas neither exist nor don't exist -- an application of the Four-Fold Negation.  There is thus only Emptiness, <I>Shunya</I>.  This was not institutionally important in Japan, but most subsequent Japanese schools regarded Nag&acirc;rjuna as one of the most important figures in the history of Buddhism.  This was also introduced in China by Kumarajiva in 408 AD;<P>

<li><a name="hossho"><I><B>Hoss&ocirc; Sh&ucirc;</B></I> [<img src="images/hiero/hosso.gif" align=middle>], introduced in 653.  This is the important <I>Vij&ntilde;&acirc;nav&acirc;din</I> or <I>Yog&acirc;c&acirc;ra</I> School from India, which held that Consciousness was the only reality (or that Consciousness is all that we can know -- scholars disagree).  <B>Vasubandhu</B>, who shifted to <a href="buddhism.htm#maha">Mah&acirc;y&acirc;na</a> ideas, and his brother, <B>Asanga</B>, as well as other Indian and Chinese figures, contributed texts used in Japan.  Hoss&ocirc; is a minor school but still with an important center at the K&ocirc;fukuji temple in Nara.  The School had been introduced in China by Hs&uuml;an Tsang (after his <a href="sangoku.htm#thanesar">pilgrimage</a> to India, 629-645) in 648 AD;<P>

<li><a name="ritsu"><I><B>Ritsu Sh&ucirc;</B></I> [<img src="images/hiero/ritsu.gif" align=middle>], introduced in 754, focused on Buddhist monastic discipline (the <I>Vinaya</I>).  This was institutionally important in Japan only as it was revived in a Shingon version (<I>Shingon Rissh&ucirc;</I>) by Eizon (1201-1290) at the Saidaiji in Nara.  This was introduced to China by Tao Hs&uuml;an around 650 AD; and<P>

<li><a name="kegon"><I><B>Kegon Sh&ucirc;</B></I> [<img src="images/hiero/kegon.gif" align=middle>], introduced in 735.  This is the important Chinese <I>Hua-yen</I> School of <B>Fa-tsang</B> (643-712) and Hsien Shou (712).  Its institutional base, still at the magnificent <I>T&ocirc;daiji</I> temple in Nara, was the most important of its time, but its subtle metaphysics failed to attract much popular following.

<P><a name="heian"><hr>

<P>The Six Schools expanded to Eight in the <a href="sangoku.htm#heian">Heian Period</a> (794-1185), when the capital moved permanently to Ky&ocirc;to:<P>

<li><a name="tendai"><I><B>Tendai Sh&ucirc;</B></I> [<img src="images/hiero/tendai.gif" align=middle>], the important Chinese <I>T'ien T'ai</I> School, founded by <B>Chih I</B> in 575 AD, brought back from China by <B>Saich&ocirc;</B> (767-822) in 805.  <a href="yinyang.htm"><img src="images/trigram2.gif" align=right border=0></a>Tendai became the institutionally and politically dominant form of Japanese Buddhism when Saich&ocirc; began what later turned into a vast establishment of temples and hermitages (the "Three Pagodas and Sixteen Valleys") on the <a href="romania.htm#mountain">sacred mountain</a>, <B><I>Mt. Hiei</I></B>, looming over the city of Ky&ocirc;to to the northeast, the direction of the "mountain" <a href="yinyang.htm">trigram</a> and the perilous "Demon Gate," which could thus be guarded by the temples.  Most of the Kamakura schools were essentially spinoffs from Tendai, which emphasized Nirv&acirc;n.a in this life, the power of the <I>Lotus Sutra</I> -- <img src="images/hiero/lotus-1.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/lotus-2.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/jing-1.gif" align=middle>, <I>My&ocirc;h&ocirc;-Renge-ky&ocirc;</I> in Japanese -- and devotion to the Buddha <a href="elements.htm#buddhist">Amit&acirc;bha</a>, <img src="images/hiero/a.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/amida.gif" align=middle>, <I>Amida</I> in Japanese, whose Pure Land was available to anyone who invoked the power of the Vow of Amida with the <I>Nembutsu</I> mantra:  &nbsp;"<I>Namu Amida Butsu</I> [<img src="images/hiero/south.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/wu-mo.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/a.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/amida.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/buddha.gif" align=middle><img src="images/ancestr1.gif" align=middle>]."  Tendai practice on Mt. Hiei was <I>Lotus Sutra</I> in the morning, Pure Land in the evening.  This was vividly formalized by the Abbot Ry&ocirc;gen in 936, when corresponding adjacent halls for Lotus and Pure Land practice were joined by a covered walkway -- creating a <img src="images/hiero/carry.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/hall-1.gif" align=middle>, Japanese <I>Ninaid&ocirc;</I>, or "carrying hall," i.e. by analogy to the two buckets at the ends of a carrying pole.  This duality is expressed in the saying <I>Asa Daimoku, Y&ucirc; Nembutsu</I>, <img src="images/hiero/morning.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/title.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/eye2.gif" align=middle>, <img src="images/hiero/evening.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/think.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/buddha.gif" align=middle>, "Morning <I>Daimoku</I> [the title of the <I>Lotus Sutra</I>], Evening <I>Nembutsu</I>."  The dualism of this was subsequently broken by <a href="#jodo">H&ocirc;nen</a>, who posited the <I>Nembutsu</I> as the <I>only</I> effective practice in the Final Dharma Age of <a href="buddhism.htm#mappo"><I>Mapp&ocirc;</I></a>.  <a href="#nichiren">Nichiren</a> responded to this by asserting that only the <I>Lotus Sutra</I> was the final and effective practice in <I>Mapp&ocirc;</I>.  Consequently, <I>Asa Daimoku, Y&ucirc; Nembutsu</I> began to mean "can't make up your mind" -- their unity in Tendai practice was often forgotten.  The monastic army of Mt. Hiei was long a factor in the politics of Ky&ocirc;to, until in 1571 it was destroyed and the mountain burned by the "Dictator" <a href="sangoku.htm#azuchi">Oda Nobunaga</a>; and<br clear=right>

<li><a name="shingon"><I><B>Shingon Sh&ucirc;</B></I> [<img src="images/hiero/shingon.gif" align=middle>], the Esoteric or <a href="buddhism.htm#vajra">Vajray&acirc;na</a> school (<I>Chen Yen</I>, founded in China by Vajrabodhi in 719 AD) brought back from China by <B>K&ucirc;kai</B> (K&ocirc;b&ocirc;-Daishi, 774-835) in 806.  K&ucirc;kai is a legendary figure in Japan, often supposed to still be walking alive among the living and working miracles.  Shingon became established at the important T&ocirc;ji temple in Ky&ocirc;to and at the site of K&ucirc;kai's tomb on Mt. K&ocirc;ya -- where the sage sits in meditation, either mummified or deathless, as one prefers.  His body has never been open for public inspection.

<P><a name="kamkura"><hr>

<P>During the Period of the <a href="sangoku.htm#kamakura">Kamakura Sh&ocirc;guns</a> (1185-1333) the traditional number of schools expanded to Twelve:<P>

<li><a name="zen"><I><B>Zen Sh&ucirc;</B></I> [<img src="images/hiero/zen.gif" align=middle>], the important Chinese <I><B>Ch'an</B></I> School, supposedly founded in China by Bodhidharma in 520 AD, first successfully brought from China by Eisai (1141-1215) in 1192.  In 1227 <B>D&ocirc;gen</B> (1200-1253) founded the Japanese version of the important <I><B>S&ocirc;t&ocirc;</B></I> branch of Zen.  Both men had also studied at Mt. Hiei.  Often said to be the favorite School of the <a href="divebomb.htm">Samurai</a> warriors, who, however, actually preferred J&ocirc;do;<P>

<li><a name="jodo"><I><B>J&ocirc;do Sh&ucirc;</B></I> [<img src="images/hiero/jodo.gif" align=middle>], the "Pure Land," Sect founded by <B>H&ocirc;nen</B> (1133-1212) in 1174.  One of the most widespread forms of Buddhism, though in Japan it is J&ocirc;do Shin Sh&ucirc; (see next) that has the largest membership.  The first "single practice" sect, with exclusive devotion to the <a href="elements.htm#buddhism"><img src="images/bodhi01.gif" align=right border=0>Buddha Amit&acirc;bha</a>, or Amida in Japanese, using the mantra <I>Namu Amida Butsu</I> [<img src="images/hiero/south.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/wu-mo.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/a.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/amida.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/buddha.gif" align=middle><img src="images/ancestr1.gif" align=middle>].  Nevertheless, the sect is regarded as founded in China by Hui Y&uuml;an in 402 AD;<P>

<li><a name="shin"><I><B>J&ocirc;do Shin Sh&ucirc;</B></I> [<img src="images/hiero/jodo2.gif" align=middle>], the "True Pure Land," Sect, a uniquely Japanese form of Buddhism, founded in 1224 by <B>Shinran</B> (1174-1268), who married, taught salvation by faith alone (in Amida's Vow), and consequently has been called the "Martin Luther of Japan" -- first of all by early Jesuit missionaries in Japan, such as, Alessandro Valignano, who of course did not regard this as to the credit of Shinran; and<P>

<li><a name="nichiren"><I><B>Hokke</B></I> [<img src="images/hiero/hokke.gif" align=middle>], "Lotus," or <I><B>Nichiren Sh&ucirc;</B></I> [<img src="images/hiero/nichiren.gif" align=middle><img src="images/ancestr2.gif" align=middle>] Sect, <img src="images/lotus.jpg" align=right>also uniquely Japanese, founded in 1253 by <B>Nichiren</B> (1222-1282), who taught salvation by faith in the <I>Lotus Sutra</I>, especially by invoking its title, the <I>Daimoku</I>, <img src="images/hiero/title.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/eye2.gif" align=middle>, in the mantra "<I>Namu My&ocirc;h&ocirc;-Renge-Ky&ocirc;</I> [<img src="images/hiero/south.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/wu-mo.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/lotus-1.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/lotus-2.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/jing-1.gif" align=middle>]."  Nichiren seem to have been reacting against the single practice <I>J&ocirc;do</I> innovation of H&ocirc;nen, with the result that Nichiren and H&ocirc;nen represent a kind of schism of Tendai, separating Tendai Pure Land and <I>Lotus</I> veneration into separate sectarian practices.

<P>A fierce polemicist, Nichiren and then his followers became known for annoying the government, engaging in acrimonious, distruptive debate with other sects, and refusing to participate in the sort of eclectic practices common to Japanese religion or to accept money from non-believers, including even the <a href="sangoku.htm#kamakura">Sh&ocirc;guns</a>.  The latter refusal was often interpreted as <I>l&egrave;se majest&eacute;</I> and provoked torture, executions, and suppression of particularly offensive parts of the Sect.  Apart from Christians, Nichiren Buddhism thus probably has the largest number of <a href="sangoku.htm#nichiren"><I>martyrs</I></a> in Japanese religious history.  Shown below is a Nichiren Sh&ucirc; temple in Izu, with its distinctive banners of the <I>Daimoku</I>.  Nichiren Sh&ucirc; is the principle Nichiren sect in Japan, but it is less infamous than Nichiren Sh&ocirc;sh&ucirc;, perhaps the most rigorous of the Nichiren sects, and previously conspicuous for its large lay organization, the Soka Gakkai, which helped spread Nichiren Sh&ocirc;sh&ucirc; overseas.  <img src="images/nichi-01.jpg" align=left width=480>The "Gakkai" and Nichiren Sh&ocirc;sh&ucirc;, however, split in 1991, principally over the ambition of the Gakkai to be, as it were, the tail wagging the dog.  For instance, in Southern California, where the Soka Gakkai headquarters was on Wilshire Blvd. in Santa Monica, one of the busiest places in the metropolitan area, the My&ocirc;h&ocirc;ji temple was located in Rancho Cucamonga, well East of Los Angeles, to prevent casual contact between Gakkai members and the priesthood.  After the split, the My&ocirc;h&ocirc;ji was relocated to Crescent Heights Blvd. in Hollywood.<br clear=right>

<P>All the Kamakura schools were more interested in practice than in speculative metaphysics and consequently came to dominate popular religion.<p>
