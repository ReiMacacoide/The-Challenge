<P>The <I>Tao Te Ching</I>, <img src="images/hiero/jing.gif" align=middle>, the "<a href="confuci.htm#classics">Classic</a> of the Way and Virtue" (or, the "Power of the Way," the "Way and Its Power," etc.), is the first and principal Classic of <a href="six.htm#tao">Taoism</a>.  It is handed down with a division into two books.  This was often thought to be an arbitrary division; but recently a manuscript was discovered in which the order of the two books was actually reversed.  An interpretation has now been offered that the two books are intended to be about the <I>Tao</I> [<img src="images/dao2.gif" align=middle>] and <I>Te</I> [<img src="images/te.gif" align=middle>], respectively.  Book I does begin with statements about the <I>Tao</I>, and Book II with statements about <I>Te</I>.  Since the <I>Tao</I> might be thought to be more important than <I>Te</I>, the format that reverses the books may then simply reflect that judgment, with the treatment of <I>Te</I> as an introduction or preliminary to the <I>Tao</I>.  It is not clear that reversing the order would really make any difference in the teaching.

<P>Joanna C. Lee and Ken Smith, who have a good translation and provide both characters and a Pinyin transcription (all but unheard of in other translations), simply break the <I>Tao Te Ching</I> into two separate little books, <I>The Pocket Tao, Lao Tzu's Classic of the Way</I> [A Museworks Book, Pocket Chinese Classics, 2012] and <I>The Pocket Te, Lao Tzu's Classic of Virtue</I> [A Museworks Book, Pocket Chinese Classics, 2013].  The order in which to read these is thus up to the reader.

<P>This webpage originally wrote up the comments I would make in my <a href="valley/#1">Introduction to Philosophy</a> and <a href="valley/#30">Asian Philosophy</a> classes, from 1987 to 2009, and so sometimes comments are directly addressed to students.  The classes used the D.C. Lau translation:  &nbsp;Lao Tzu, <I>Tao Te Ching</I> [Penguin Books, 1963].  Over the years maintenance of the page has involved adding material, especially Chinese text, and more in the way of critique of the translations by Lau and others.  <a href="bellos.htm">Translating</a> the <I>Tao Te Ching</I> is a challenge, as examined in detail for the first chapter below.

<P>After this page was first on line, and most students still had no access to the Internet, the <a href="valley/">Valley College</a> Bookstore would print out and bind copies of the file, which students could purchase.  Soon, however, people could sit in class with their own laptops and read the webpage during the lecture.  The phenomenon was just beginning, of background noise in classes, with people typing notes on their laptops, before I retired in 2009.

<P><ul>
<li><a name="book-1">Book I:  So Book I here may be specifically dedicated to the Tao, with perhaps a paradox that Book II, on <I>Te</I>, deals with something arguably less important, as an afterthought.

<P><ul><li><a name="chap-1">Chapter I

<br>Comparing our edition with other translations of the <I>Tao Te Ching</I>, you may discover that they can be wildly different.  One problem is just that <a href="yinyang.htm#dialects4">ancient Chinese</a> really is a different language from modern Chinese.  This can create uncertainties even in translating <a href="confuci.htm">Confucius</a>, who was trying to be clear and simple.  But the problems multiply with Taoism, which is often deliberately obscure and paradoxical.  Why Taoism is that way is explained by the first verse:  the <I>Tao</I> really cannot be spoken of or named.

<P><ul>
<li><img src="images/taote-2.gif" align=right>Verse 1: "The Way that can be spoken of, Is not the constant way."  The <I>Tao Te Ching</I> begins with a pun:  "Way" and "spoken of" ("said") are the same character, <img src="images/dao2.gif" align=middle>.  So the first line says:  "The <I>Tao</I> that can be <I>tao-ed</I> is not the constant <I>Tao</I>."  Next we get a similar pun with, "The name that can be named..."  Here the pun can be maintained in English, where "name" can be both noun and verb, as with Chinese <img src="images/hiero/sch-name.gif" align=middle>.

<P>The quality or preconceptions of a translation of the <I>Tao Te Ching</I> can usually be determined from the rendering of these lines.  Those determined to unpack the meaning of Taoism in the translation, according to their own interpretation of Taoist doctrine, will often render these terse sentences into a paragraph, sometimes with irrecognizable renderings of the key words.  The affection of a translator for Taoism cannot excuse a method that only obscures the nature of the text itself.

<P>Let's look at some translations, old and recent, of just the first six characters.
<ol>
<li>Most venerable of all is that of James Legge in 1891: &nbsp;"The T&acirc;o that can be trodden [<font color=red>!!</font>] is not the enduring and unchanging T&acirc;o" [Dover, 1962, p.47].
<li>Then we have D.T. Suzuki and Paul Carus in 1913 & 1927:  &nbsp;"The Reason that can be reasoned is not the eternal Reason" [Open Court, 1974, p.74].
<li>Next let's see Archie Bahm (whom I knew at the <a href="./ross/">University of New Mexico</a> in 1967):  &nbsp;"Nature can never be completely described, for such a description of Nature would have to duplicate Nature" [Frederick Ungar Publishing, 1958, p.11].
<li>D.C. Lau in 1963:  &nbsp;"The way that can be spoken of / Is not the constant way" [Penguin, 1963, p.5].
<li>Hua-Ching Ni in 1979, with what appears to be more an "elucidation" than a translation:  &nbsp;"Tao, the subtle reality of the universe cannot be described" [Seven Star Communciations, 1979, 2003, p.7].
<li>Tam C. Gibbs in 1981:  &nbsp;"The tao that can be said is not the everlasting Tao" [North Atlantic Books, 1981, p.20].
<li>More recently, we get Victor Mair in 1990, who switches Book I and Book II, displacing the 1st Chapter to the 45th:  &nbsp;"The ways that can be walked [<font color=red>!!</font>] are not the eternal Way" [Bantam, 1990, p.59].
<li>Michael LaFargue in 1992, who insists on completely rearranging the chapters, displacing the 1st to the 43rd, under the larger heading of "Knowledge, Learning, and Teaching," with ten other chapters:  &nbsp;"The Tao that can be told is not the invariant Tao" [State University of New York Press, 1992, p.84].
<li>The science fiction novelist Ursula Le Guin in 1997:  &nbsp;"The way you can go [<font color=red>!!</font>] / isn't the real way" [Shambala, 1998, p.3].
<li>Moss Roberts from 2001:  &nbsp;"The Way as 'way' bespeaks no common lasting Way" [University of California Press, 2001, p.27].
<li>Roger T. Ames and David L. Hall, who have a slightly different Chinese text, in 2003:  &nbsp;"Way-making (<I>dao</I>) that can be put into words is not really way-making" [Ballantine, 2003, p.77]
<li>Charles Muller in 2005:  &nbsp;"The Tao that can be followed [<font color=red>!!</font>] is not the eternal Tao" [Barnes and Noble Classics, 2005, p.3].
<li>And finally let's try Joanna C. Lee and Ken Smith in 2012:  &nbsp;"The Way that is speakable is not the constant Way." [Museworks Books, Hong Kong, 2012, p.17].
</ol>

<P>The worst temptation here was an interpretive, rather than <a href="bellos.htm">literal</a>, rendering of <img src="images/dao2.gif" align=middle>, like "Reason" or "Nature."  A serious question about translation is with <I>t&agrave;o</I> as a verb.  Since the noun can mean "road, way, path," Legge, Mair, Le Guin, and Muller are all tempted to produce a corresponding verb, "tred," "walk," "go," or "follow" -- which I have indicated with "<font color=red>!!</font>".  However, although <I>Mathews' Chinese Dictionary</I> [Harvard, 1972, pp.882-884] gives verbal meanings for the character as "speak, tell" (or even "lead, guide"), "tred," "walk," "go," or "follow" is not among them.  Interestingly, no one has tried the translation, "The Tao that guides is not the constant Tao."  The feeling seems to be that the Tao <I>does</I> guide.  Indeed, in Chinese philosophy a "Way" means the actions recommended by any particular school or teaching, not just Taoism.  On the other hand, if the line denies that the Tao can be followed, this would seem to void the entire purpose of a Taoist teaching.  By Not-Doing, <img src="images/hiero/wu-not.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/wei-do.gif" align=middle>, after all, one <I><B>can</B></I> "tred," "walk," "go," or "follow" the Way.  The approach that began with Legge would deny the possibility, not of speech about, but of conformity to the Tao.  This does not otherwise appear to be the thrust of the teaching.  Indeed, if the Way is something that cannot be followed, how can it be the Way?  And what are we supposed to do instead?  Indeed, we do nothing, but then that is precisely what following the Way is.  So by not following it, we follow it.  The renderings that are the most interpretative rather than simply translating are Bahm, Ni, and Roberts.  Roberts seems to be at pains to take "way" in its simplest and most literal meaning, and not as referring to the hidden and obscure entity, the force behind "not doing," that everyone else takes the Tao to be.  But construing the sentence his way requires an awkward locution and liberties with the wording.  Lee and Smith return to the simplest and most faithful rendering -- while also giving us the Chinese text and a Pinyin transcription, the latter or both of which are missing from most other editions.

<li>Verse 2: <img src="images/hiero/wu-not.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/sch-name.gif" align=middle>, "The nameless."  The <I>Tao</I> is really nameless.  Why it is called the "<I>Tao</I>" we will see later.  This matches the verse about the <I>Tao</I>, with <img src="images/hiero/sch-name.gif" align=middle>, "name," as noun and verb in place of "tao" as noun and verb.
</ul><p>

<li><a name="chap-3">Chapter III
<ul>
<li><img src="images/hiero/verse08.gif" align=right>Verse 8: "Not to honour men of worth will keep the people from contention; not to value goods which are hard to come by will keep them from theft; not to display what is desirable will keep them from being unsettled of mind."  We might think that honoring the worthy would encourage them and others who might aspire to worth.  But the Taoist worries about the conflict that could result between contenders for honors.  Indeed, the Taoist would not seek honor in the first place, since it would mean putting himself forward when the Tao really accomplished whatever needed to be done.  So the Taoist ruler will act like the men of worth themselves desire no honors.  Next, if you do not wish to obtain valuable goods, or to value them yourself, then people will see no reason to become robbers.  In the next statement there is a question about the translation.  Where D.C. Lau says "not to display what is desirable," Joanna C. Lee & Ken Smith say simply, "Eschews desires."  "Display" seems to be what doesn't go with the characters, and we could even translate the four characters as "Do not (even) see what you might desire."  This means avoiding desires, which would be a Taoist sentiment.  Then, if the ruler has no desires, disorders (not just being "unsettled of mind") will not arise among the people.  As in Confucianism, the actions of the ruler set the pattern for the people.  With the Taoist ruler, we may have an ambiguity that either we want the people to not even notice the ruler, or we want the people to notice that the ruler has no desires and does not value things that might arouse competition and conflict in the people.<br clear=right>

<li>Verse 9: "Therefore in governing the people, the sage empties their mind but fills their bellies, weakens their wills but strengthens their bones.  <img src="images/hiero/verse09.gif" align=right>He always keeps them innocent of knowledge and free from desire."  Unfortunately, at least part of this sounds too much like modern government, which can "empty their minds" with modern "<a href="public.htm">education</a>" and "weaken their wills" with unavoidable bureaucracy and arbitrary authority, while actually neither feeding them nor strengthening bones.  Thus, the hunger in <a href="newspain.htm#venezuela">Venezuela</a> does not seem to bother American partisans of the regime, including Members of Congress, which properly makes us wonder what they really intend.  For the Taoist ruler, keeping the people ignorant and "free from desire" is supposed to allow them to flourish under the Tao.  However, this is as likely to make them inert, which will not benefit them.  But unlike the modern politician, the Taoist ruler at least makes no attempt to instill fear, obedience, and control.  He should be invisible.<br clear=right>

<li>Verse 9:  "And ensures that the clever never dare act."  This statement, <img src="images/hiero/verse09a.gif" align=right>placed by D.C. Lau with verse 9, is translated by Joanna C. Lee & Ken Smith in conjunction with the next statement, in Lau's verse 10.  The translation is also a bit different, with Lee & Smith saying, "Even the ambitious dare not go too far."  I think "clever" might be closer here than "ambitious," and it looks like "never dare act" is more like it than "dare not go too far."  Note that the terms used here are not those for the Taoist sage, who is called "sacred," while whoever this is merely has knowledge.  Thus if we translate <img src="images/zhi4.gif" align=middle> as "<a href="wisdom.htm">wisdom</a>," it will be more the kind of wisdom that St. Paul regards as inadequate or deceptive:  "If any one among you thinks that he is wise in this age, let him become a fool that he may become wise" [1 Corinthians 3:18].  Sounds very Taoist.<br clear=right>

<li>Verse 10:  "Do that which consists in taking no action, and order will prevail."  The basic principle of Taoism, that order results from inaction, while disorder results from action.  Attempting to control things actually messes them up.  <img src="images/hiero/verse10.gif" align=right>We might note with this principle that the expression <img src="images/hiero/wei-do.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/wu-not.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/wei-do.gif" align=middle> literally can mean "do not-doing," which means that "not doing" is indeed something that one can "do" -- although <img src="images/hiero/wei-do.gif" align=middle> can also mean "by means of," which will also work (we can even strengthen that by changing the tone, <img src="images/hiero/wei-for.gif" align=middle>, now "for, because of, on account of").  Also of particular interest is the final character, <img src="images/hiero/zhi1.gif" align=middle>, which first of all can mean "to cure, heal," but then "to govern, regulate, put in order," and finally, "the result of the previous, the peace under good government"  [<I>Mathews' Chinese Dictionary</I>, Harvard, 1972, p.141].  The choice of this character can thus imply that the whole expression is not just talking about Taoist practice in general, which may apply to the hermit or mendicant, but specifically to government.  In different translations, we thus may see this rendered in slightly different but interesting ways, mostly ignoring the double negative.  D.C. Lau says "order will prevail," Joanna C. Lee & Ken Smith says, "sustains the natural order," and Man-jan Cheng & Tam C. Gibbs say, "well regulated" [<I>Lao-Tzu: "My words are very easy to understand"</I>, Lectures on the <I>Tao Teh Ching</I> by Man-jan Cheng, trnslated by Tam C. Gibbs, North Atlantic Books, 1981, p.29].

<li><a name="notkind">Chapter V
<ul><li>Verse 14:  "Heaven and earth are ruthless..."  <img src="images/hiero/heaven.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/earth3.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/buren.gif" align=middle>.  Although Taoism sometimes sounds very pacifistic, it is possible to wage war on Taoist principles; and here it is recognized that nature, and so the <I>Tao</I>, is not always kind (<img src="images/ren2.gif" align=middle>).  Indeed, "ruthless" here translates <img src="images/hiero/buren.gif" align=middle>, "not kind," "not benevolent," or "not humane."  Roger T. Ames and David L. Hall in their "philosophical translation" apparently don't like the implications of this, so they translate the verse as, "The heavens and the earth are not partial to institutionalized morality" [p.84].  This might indeed be a Taoist sentiment, but it is perhaps an over-interpretive reach as a translation of a line with only four characters.  In a footnote, their justification of it is that <I>r&eacute;n</I> represents "a suspect Confucian value that emerges only when genuine moral feeling has been overwritten by conventionalized rules of living" [p.206].  This is not quite right.  The <I>substance</I> of the Confucian virtue is not suspect; it is that the virtue is <I>subverted</I> by Confucian speech about it.  Is that the implication here?  It doesn't look like it to me.  The more sensible reading is the obvious one, that nature is not always benevolent, as indeed it is not.  On the other hand, whatever the interpretation ought to be, the purpose of a translation is to <I>render</I> the plain meaning of the original, not to <I>obscure</I> it with an editorial.  The worst feature of the Ames and Hall "translation" is that it is impossible to tell even remotely what the original wording would have been.  The reader is simply not allowed to interpret the text for himself.  The statement further, that Heaven and Hearth treat the people as "straw dogs," is easily conformable with the "not kind" translation.  What it is about "straw dogs" is not spelled out and is subject to varying interpretations, but it doesn't sound good.  We also get this all repeated in terms of <img src="images/hiero/sacred.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/person.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/buren.gif" align=middle>, "The Sage is not kind."  Ames and Hall also want to the Sage to not be "partial to institutionalized morality," as he would not; but he also treats people as "straw dogs."  The general error of Ames and Hall, that Taoism doesn't want to cite any Confucian virtues, is contradicted in Chapter XIX, where we learn that the "people will again be filial."  That is really the key to the paradoxes of Taoism.

<li><a name="chap-6">Chapter VI
<ul><li>Verse 17:  "The spirit of the valley..."  Here is the beginning of the <I><B>yin</B></I>, <img src="images/hiero/yin.gif" align=middle>, imagery of the <I>Tao Te Ching</I>.  While the <I>Tao</I> is beyond the opposites of yin and yang, <img src="images/hiero/yang.gif" align=middle>, the principles of Not Doing (<img src="images/hiero/wuwei.gif" align=middle>) and No Mind (<img src="images/hiero/wuxin.gif" align=middle>), which allow the <I>Tao</I> to operate, have a much greater affinity with yin (passive, receptive) than with yang (active, aggressive).  The <I>Tao Te Ching</I> therefore illustrates Not Doing with extensive yin imagery.  Here the "valley" (<img src="images/hiero/valley.gif" align=middle>), the "female," and perhaps the "gateway" are all yin images.
</ul><p>

<li><a name="chap-7">Chapter VII
<ul><li>Verses 19-19a:  "The Sage (<img src="images/hiero/sacred.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/person.gif" align=middle>, Japanese <I>sh&ocirc;nen</I>) puts his person last and it comes first....without thought of self that he is able to accomplish his private ends?"  If someone pursues their self-interest (practices the "doing" of self), they defeat and destroy it.  By practicing Not Doing, the sage therefore allows the <I>Tao</I> to pursue his self-interest for him, which it will do.  This all explains why the sage Lao Tzu, <img src="images/hiero/laozi.gif" align=middle>, the presumptive author of the <I>Tao Te Ching</I>, may not have existed:  &nbsp;the author or authors of the <I>Tao Te Ching</I> would not put themselves forward to claim authorship.  That would not be putting one's "person last."  It would be a much more Taoist move to deny authorship and attribute the book to the "Old Master," which is what "Lao Tzu" means.  Whether one author or many, critical references to Confucian doctrine in the book (especially Chapter 38) imply that it was written during the <a href="sangoku.htm#warring">Warring States Period</a>, while the tradition is that Lao Tzu was a contemporary of Confucius -- that they even met.
</ul><p>

<li><a name="chap-8">Chapter VIII
<ul><li>Verse 20:  <a href="elements.htm#china"><img src="images/kanji-05.gif" align=right border=0></a>"Highest good is like water."  The supreme yin image of the <I>Tao</I>:  <I><B>Water</B></I>.  Nothing is so essential to life, and so yielding and receptive; but water is also tremendously powerful and irresistible, as the Chinese know well from devastating floods of the Huang He and Yangtze rivers.  "Settles where none would like to be."  Water goes to the lowest position, which is not a status that people commonly fight over.  Thus Not Doing avoids conflict, "does not contend."
</ul><p>

<li><a name="chap-10">Chapter X
<ul><li>Verse 24:  "Can you...govern the state/Without resorting to action? ...Are you capable of keeping to the role of the female?"  When we hear about the "role of the female," it is easy to dismiss the whole thing as some traditional, patriarchal instruction to women to stay in their place.  However, this will not do for the <I>Tao Te Ching</I>.  For one thing, in the traditional, indeed patriarchal Chinese society of the time, women mostly would not be able to read.  They would not be reading the <I>Tao Te Ching</I>.  So the advice is not to women, it is to rulers.  The rulers are being told to keep to the "role of the female," i.e. the <I>yin</I> interpretation of Not Doing.
</ul><p>

<li><a name="chap-11">Chapter XI
<ul><li>Verses 27-27a:  "Adapt the nothing therein..."  The <I>Tao</I>, in contrast to objects, appears to be Nothing, but it underlies and governs all things.  So, "by virtue of Nothing," "what we gain is Something," as the <I>Tao</I> generates growth, usefulness, beauty, etc.  This is compared to the nature of mundane objects like bowls:  their Emptiness is what makes them useful.  The material of a bowl merely enables us to use the Emptiness to put things in.  Similarly, the spokes of a wheel enable us to use the emptiness of the wheel; the emptiness of doors and windows enables us to go in and out and to have light and air in a room, which itself is useful through its Emptiness.  This Emptiness of the <I>Tao</I> then appears in Chinese art, which can often be very busy and densely decorated, but under the influence of Taoism can also be very plain and undecorated.  Chinese landscape paintings especially may be mostly empty space, with mountains and clouds trailing off into misty distance.  The emptiness in the painting is just as important, or more important, than the painted part:  It represents the <I>Tao</I>.
</ul><p>

<li><a name="chap-12">Chapter XII
<ul><li>Verse 28:  "The five colours make man's eyes blind."  The classic Taoist paradox.  One might think that <I>without</I> the colors, one would be blind; but Taoism says that the colors themselves are blinding if you are <I>thinking</I> about them rather than <I>seeing</I> them.  To think, "Oh, colors," is <I><B>not</B></I> to see them.  Only with No Mind, without thought, will they really be seen.  Similarly, thinking about notes or tastes is to close out the actual sounds and flavors.  Also note the sets of fives here.  The world is already being ordered in reference to the <a href="elements.htm#china">five Chinese elements</a>.
</ul><p>

<li><a name="chap-17">Chapter XVII
<ul><li>Verses 39-41:  "The best of all rulers is but a shadowy presence..."  The essence of Taoist political advice.  The ruler practicing Not Doing will not even be noticed, whatever it is that he is literally doing.  "The people all say, 'It happened to us naturally.'"  Thus the ruler's actions are not distinguishable from natural events, since they are indeed at one with the <I>Tao</I>.  This would be unwelcome advice to any modern politician.  Nevertheless, a ideal that a "government that governs best, governs least" was expressed by <a href="presiden.htm#3">Thomas Jefferson</a> -- the ideal of a <a href="freestat.htm">liberal democracy</a>, a government of limited and enumerated powers.  This has been a difficult ideal to enforce or maintain, and now has largely been given up by political elites and in popular consciousness.  The most Jeffersonian American President of the 20th century was probably <a href="presiden.htm#30">Calvin Coolidge</a>, who presided over tremendous growth and prosperity, yet is despised by intellectuals precisely for being "a shadowy presence" -- although he gave frequent radio addresses and news conferences, now forgotten (also the last President to daily greet ordinary visitors to the White House).  "Next comes the ruler they love and praise."  This would be the Confucian ideal of a ruler, who conspicuously sets an example of goodness and so who will be loved and praised.  "Next comes one they fear."  A ruler who uses force may be obeyed, as long as the force is credible.  The best historical example would be Shihuangdi (246-209), although he probably reigned subsequent to the composition of the <I>Tao Te Ching</I>.  Shihuangdi was ruthless enough that he was effective during his lifetime, but after his death the <a href="sangoku.htm#ch'in">Qin Dynasty</a> (255-207) rapidly crumbled.  <img src="images/hiero/taote-2.gif" align=right>"Next comes one with whom they take liberties," like the younger son who succeeded Shihuangdi and was overthrown.

<P>The translation of this passage is vulnerable to wildly different interpretations.  Thus, it begins with two characters, <img src="images/hiero/grand.gif" align=middle><img src="images/greek/high.gif" align=middle>, that can mean several things.  James Legge renders it as "in highest antiquity," but then he proceeds to interpret the reference as otherwise to the ancient and best rulers [<I>op. cit.</I> Dover, 1962, p.60].  Forgetting about rulers altogether, Charles Muller translates, "From great antiquity forth they have known and possessed it" [<I>op.cit.</I>, Barnes and Noble Classics, 2005].  He seems to think that the passage refers to the Tao, but then to get this he leaves out the negation.  Indeed, the Chinese texts of the <I>Tao Te Ching</I> available from various sources often leave out either the character <img src="images/greek/low.gif" align=middle>, "below," or the character <img src="images/no-1.gif" align=middle>, "not."  Muller is apparently relying on there not being a negation.  He also takes <img src="images/hiero/exist.gif" align=middle> to mean "have" rather than "exist," which is an alternative meaning.  Unless he also leaves out <img src="images/greek/low.gif" align=middle>, however, or is simply translating it as "they," he misses the point that "below" contrasts with "above," which is taken by other translators to mean the "subjects" as contrasted with the ruler who is "above."  The expression <img src="images/hiero/grand.gif" align=middle><img src="images/greek/high.gif" align=middle>, according to <I>Mathews' Chinese Dictionary</I>, can mean "heaven" or "a title of respect" [p.862].  "Heaven" would not be the same as the Tao, as Muller might be thinking (as an alternative to "great antiquity"), and the "title of respect" is what implies that this is a ruler.  While D.C. Lau has a charming expression that the ruler is "but a shadowy presence," if the text says that the subjects don't even know that he exists, this hardly needs such embelishment.  Similarly, while Lau ends the sequence that the ruler will be one "with whom they take liberties," the blunt statement that the subjects will insult him again hardly seems in need of an alternative expression.  Another curious variation in the text occurs in Paul Carus [Open Court, 1974], who has <img src="images/hiero/zhi2.gif" align=middle> instead of <img src="images/hiero/and.gif" align=middle> in the middle of "love and praise" [p.34].  This doesn't affect his translation very much [p.84], but it does otherwise seem awkward in the structure of the passage.

<li><a name="chap-18">Chapter XVIII
<ul><li>Verse 42: "When the great way falls into disuse, There are benevolence and rectitude."  Again, this is the opposite of what we would expect.  Without the "Way," benevolence and rectitude would disappear, not appear.  However, what Taoism means is that without the <I>Tao</I>, we <I><B>talk about</B></I> benevolence and rectitude, which have <I>actually</I> disappeared.   Thus, <img src="images/hiero/taote42a.gif" align=right>you ordinarily don't notice or appreciate how healthy you are until you get sick.  Then you <I>talk about</I> health.  Talking, however, doesn't bring it back.  Similarly with the moral qualities.  It is significant that "benevolence and rectitude" (<I>r&eacute;n</I> and <I>y&igrave;</I>) are the two principal virtues of Confucius.  Talking about benevolence and rectitude is what Confucius actually did.  The Taoist critique is that the talking doesn't help.  Indeed, talking about it really will <I>prevent</I> the <I>Tao</I> from restoring the real things.  The tip-off is then that the appearance of "cleverness" or "intelligence" and "knowledge" or "wisdom" result in "great hypocrisy."  Manifest qualities that should be good instead produce misuse.  The Sage, with genuine intelligence and wisdom, is not noticed.

<P>Also, "When cleverness emerges, There is great hypocrisy."  This is something else:  Taoism wants a simple, rural life.  It doesn't like "cleverness" or "novelties."  It is hard to imagine the Taoist sage in a city -- he is usually to be imagined as a hermit or wanderer in the forest (<img src="images/hiero/lin.gif" align=middle>), mountains (<img src="images/hiero/mountain.gif" align=middle>), or countryside, often only uttering paradoxical statements.  We see this in the character <img src="images/hiero/immortal.gif" align=middle>, "an immortal," which contains the character for "mountain" with the radical for "person," <img src="images/hiero/person.gif" align=middle>.  The idea seems to be that immortal beings live in the mountains, either because that is where the divine belong (as on Mt. Olympus) or because that it where Taoist adepts, who achieve immortality, practice their asceticism (wa with Japanese practicing "mountain asceticism" in proximity to the <I>kami</I>).  Thus, Taoists themselves can be called <img src="images/hiero/immortal.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/school1.gif" align=middle>, the "immortal-ists" or "school of the immortals."  The Confucian sage, on the other hand, is intrinsically urban, and most easily imagined actually in a Chinese judge's robes (like the Chinese <a href="confuci.htm#note-4">god</a> <img src="images/hiero/fu-2.gif" align=middle>, whose name can mean "success" or "official salary").  "Immortal," however, can be contasted with <img src="images/hiero/common.gif" align=middle>, "common, vulgar, worldly."  This contains the "valley" character (<img src="images/hiero/valley.gif" align=middle>) with the radical for "person."  What is down in the valley is then common, mundane, and vulgar.

<P><img src="images/hiero/taote42b.gif" align=right>"When the six relations are at variance, There are filial children."  This isn't exactly what it says in Chinese.  When the <a href="confuci.htm#six">Six Relations</a> are not in <img src="images/hiero/v-harmon.gif" align=middle>, "harmony" (<I>wa</I> in Japanese), then what exists is filial piety (<img src="images/hiero/v-piety.gif" align=middle>) and affection.  As we have been seeing, when filial piety and affection are <I>not</I> actually observed, then we talk about, and prevent there being, these filial qualities.  D.C. Lau says "children," but this gives us too narrow a focus.

<P>"When the state is benighted, There are loyal ministers."  Note that Lau's "loyal" here is <I>chung</I>, <img src="images/hiero/zhong.gif" align=middle>, which could be better translated "conscientious."  "Loyal" ends up the exclusive meaning in Japanese (<I>ch&ucirc;</I>), <img src="images/hiero/taote42c.gif" align=right>which unfortunately comes to mean <I>blind</I> loyalty and obedience, contrary to the principles of either Confucianism or Taoism.  As above, when the state is in bad shape (where we literally get "darkness" and "disorder"), then we talk about, because there aren't any, conscientious ministers.

<P>The expression here variously translated as "state," "country," or "nation," <img src="images/hiero/kingdom.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/school1.gif" align=middle>, is of interest in its own right.  The binome adds to the character <img src="images/hiero/kingdom.gif" align=middle>, which already means "state" or "country" (<I>koku</I> or <I>kuni</I> in Japanese). the character <img src="images/hiero/school1.gif" align=middle>, which can actually mean "family," as well as a member of a <a href="six.htm#china">school</a> or organization.  So, however we look at it, "nation" may be a better translation when it implies the people who are the citizens or subjects of the state.  The country and its people.

<P>Note here that the Taoist critique apparently presupposes the moral reality of the Six Relations, which includes that of conscientious ministers, and thus accepts, in its own way, this feature of Confucian ethics.  With Taoist recluses wandering around and shunning ordinary society, we might take the Taoists to be anarchists; but there is no indication in Taoist doctrine or lore that such is the case.  The hermits who occasionally offer their services to rulers, like Kung-ming (<I>Kongming</I>) below, are the exception that prove the rule:  Taoism values an orderly society and a strong state.
</ul><p>

<li><a name="chap-19">Chapter XIX
<ul><li>Verse 43:  "Exterminate benevolence, discard rectitude,/And the people will again be filial."  This gives away the paradox:  Filial piety will return when we stop <I>talking about</I> moral virtues.

<li><a name="chap-22">Chapter XXII
<ul><li>Verse 50b:  "He does not show himself, and so is conspicuous."  The Taoist sage, again, practicing Not Doing.  By trying to be <I>inconspicuous</I>, that is the Not Doing of being conspicuous, so then the <I>Tao</I> makes one conspicuous.
</ul><p>

<li><a name="chap-24">Chapter XXIV

<ul><li>Verse 56:  "I know not its name/So I style it 'the way'."  Why the <I>Tao</I> is <I>called</I> the "<I>Tao</I>."  There is nothing else to call it, since "silent and void" it has no real name.
<li>Verse 58:  "Heaven on the way."  The only place where the yin imagery of the <I>Tao</I> gives way to a yang image:  Heaven is very much a yang thing, and it is subordinate to the <I>Tao</I>, but here it subordinates earth, which might be thought the supreme yin thing short of the <I>Tao</I>.  Evidently, the Chinese regard for Heaven was too much even for Taoism.

<ul><li>Verse 63:  The most extensive and evocative yin and yang imagery of the <I>Tao Te Ching</I>.  "Keep to the role of the female."  Again, this cannot be advice to women to stay in their place, since few women would originally have been reading the <I>Tao Te Ching</I>.  "Being a babe."  The desire for child-like innocence in Taoism.  "Role of the black."  The yin side again.  "Keep to the role of the disgraced."

<P>Best illustrated by a <a href="divebomb.htm">Zen</a> story about the Japanese monk Hakuin, who was accused of getting a neighborhood girl pregnant.  She didn't want to name the real father and so accused Hakuin instead.  He neither admitted nor denied being the father, only saying, "Is that so?" calmly accepting the care of the baby when it was born, even though by then he had lost his reputation.  A year later the girl named the real father to her parents.  Hakuin expressed no more surprise or concern over the apologies as he had over the accusations, and calmly returned the child when asked, again only saying, "Is that so?"  This was the "role of the disgraced" in the most literal sense. [Paul Reps, <I>Zen Flesh, Zen Bones</I>, Anchor Books, pp. 7-8].

Again, political advice, not so different from Confucius, since, if the ruler is good, people will be good without being ordered.

<ul><li>Verse 79a:  "The submissive [<img src="images/rou.gif" align=middle>] and weak [<img src="images/hiero/weak.gif" align=middle>] will overcome the hard and strong."  The "role of the female" is made more specific:  "Submissive" (<I>jou</I> in Wade-Giles and <I>r&oacute;u</I> in Pinyin) is a significant, evocative term.  The dictionary definition  of <I>r&oacute;u</I> (<I>Mathews' Chinese-English Dictionary</I>, Harvard, 1972) is "soft, pliant; yielding, gentle; to overcome by kindness."  "Submissive" in Taoism, however, is not always what it might seem.  We have all seen the Japanese pronunciation of <I>r&oacute;u</I> in the word <I>judo</I> (<img src="images/roudao.gif" align=middle>), the "Submissive Way."  But Judo really doesn't <I>look</I> very "submissive":  throwing people to the mat isn't exactly "to overcome by kindness."  As a form of Not Doing, however, the idea in Judo is <I>not</I> to originate an attack and <I>not</I> to use one's own strength:  the strength of an attacker is turned against him.  This idea was often articulated in the old "Kung Fu" television series of the 70's, with David Carradine.

<ul><li>Verse 81:  Summary of the ideas in Book I.  "The way never acts.."  D.C. Lau has taken a liberty with the translation [p.42].  <img src="images/hiero/taote-3.gif" align=right>The text has "name," not "act."  A similar statement, however, with "act," is below at 48:108.  "The myriad creatures will be transformed of their own accord....The nameless uncarved block/Is but freedom from desire."  Notice the similarity with the teaching of the <a href="gita.htm"><I>Bhagavad Gita</I></a>.  The <I>gunas</I> were all forms of desire, and liberation was therefore freedom from desire.  But freedom from desire in the <I>Gita</I> is the means to avoid rebirth, while freedom from desire in the <I>Tao Te Ching</I> is the means of liberating the <I>Tao</I>, which provides all the things that we might <I>otherwise</I> have desired anyway.  A very great difference between world-denying India and world-affirming China.

<ul><li>Verse 82:  "A man of the highest virtue [<img src="images/greek/high.gif" align=middle><img src="images/te.gif" align=middle>]," doesn't <I>talk</I> about virtue, and so actually practices it.  "A man of the lowest virtue [<img src="images/greek/low.gif" align=middle><img src="images/te.gif" align=middle>]," makes a big show and a big noise about virtue, and so is most likely a hypocrite who doesn't actually practice it.  Compare to Jesus's complaints about those who only give alms publicly (Matthew 6:2) or stand on the street corners praying (Matthew 6:5).  "A man of the highest benevolence [<img src="images/greek/high.gif" align=middle><img src="images/ren2.gif" align=middle>] acts..."  The beginning of an implicit critique of Confucianism.  <I>R&eacute;n</I> is the highest virtue for Confucius.  Taoism doesn't have too much of a problem with that.  Ames and Hall, responsible for a strange translation involving <img src="images/ren2.gif" align=middle> in chapter V, give us the translation, "Persons who are most authoritative (<I>ren</I>) do things coercively..."  Here they avoid the obvious meaning of <img src="images/ren2.gif" align=middle> again and translate the word, which has so simple a literal meaning, as "authoritative," which is absurdly far off the semantic reservation.  They apparently cannot tolerate the idea that Taoism might, even indirectly, endorse a Confucian virtue.  They also translate <img src="images/hiero/wei-do.gif" align=middle>, which simply means "do," as "do things coercively," which is absurd -- but of a piece with a desire to reach for non-existence negative meanings.  "A man of the highest rectitude [<img src="images/greek/high.gif" align=middle><img src="images/yi2.gif" align=middle>, righteousness] acts, but from ulterior motive."  Righteousness (<I>y&igrave;</I>) is the next highest Confucian virtue, but Taoism suspects those who invoke it of pursuing some self-interest.  "A man most conversant in the rites [<img src="images/greek/high.gif" align=middle><img src="images/li3.gif" align=middle>, propriety, etiquette, good manners] acts, but when no one responds rolls up his sleeves and resorts to persuasion by force."  Good manners (<I>li<sup>3</sup></I>) is the next Confucian virtue, but Taoism expects nothing but intolerance and violence from people who talk about this.  This is similar to attitudes in the 60's, when people felt that "good manners" were superficial nonsense and the preferred "counter-culture" behavior was rude and crude.  This was not too good; but now, when certain kinds of rude behavior or speech can be prosecuted as federal civil rights offenses ("hostile environment" interpretations of anti-discrimination law), the Confucian opposite feared by Taoism seems to have been reached.  "Hence when the way [<img src="images/dao2.gif" align=middle>] was lost there was virtue [<img src="images/te.gif" align=middle>]; when virtue was lost there was benevolence [<img src="images/ren2.gif" align=middle>]; when benevolence was lost there was rectitude [righteousness, <img src="images/yi2.gif" align=middle>]; when rectitude was lost there were the rites [manners, <img src="images/li3.gif" align=middle>]./The rites are the wearing thin of loyalty [conscientiousness, <img src="images/zhong2.gif" align=middle>] and good faith [<img src="images/xin.gif" align=middle>]/And the beginning of disorder [<img src="images/luan.gif" align=middle>, Japanese <I>ran</I> -- used as the title of Akira Kurosawa's 1985 Japanese movie version of <I>King Lear</I>]."

War can be waged by Taoist means, as recommended in Sun Tzu's <I>Art of War</I> [<a href="#note-1">note</a>].  <img src="images/sage.gif" align=left>Although the stereotype of the Taoist Sage is an asocial recluse, wanderer, and hermit, there is nevertheless the tradition that such a person may nevertheless turn out to be the wisest in practical, including military, matters.

Liu Pei travels three times to find Kung-ming before obtaining his services.  Then Kung-ming serves the Dynasty with superior administrative, diplomatic, strategic, and tactical abilities.  Thus, while the prevalent political ideas of classical China are Confucian, there is the suspicion that the Taoists may actually know more about the way things work -- including magical abilities, which Kung-ming also uses occasionally.

<ul><li>Verse 131:  "Wage war by being crafty."  Taoism does not mean pacifism; and a Taoist war strategy, as described by Sun Tzu, is to avoid the enemy's strength and instead undermine, like water, his weaknesses.
<li>Verse 132:  <img src="images/hiero/prohib.gif" align=middle>, "The more taboos..."  <img src="images/hiero/prohib2.gif" align=middle> is an interesting expression.  It can mean, "to shun the use of sacred names; to avoid things taboo; superstitious avoidance of things; taboo; prohibitions."  The question then might be whether the <I>Tao Te Ching</I> means specificially <a href="newotto.htm">religious prohibitions</a>, or legal prohibitions in general.  Or perhaps both.  "The more sharpened tools..."  The phrase here here is <img src="images/hiero/li.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/vessel.gif" align=middle>, where <img src="images/hiero/li.gif" align=middle> is "profit, gain, advantage," or "sharp, cutting; witty," and <img src="images/hiero/vessel.gif" align=middle> means, "vessel, utensil, implement, instrument" (see the use of this by <a href="confuciu.htm#vessel">Confucius</a>).  The expression can mean "edged tools" or "cutlery," or the meaning may be more metaphorical.  Either "sharp" can mean <I>mentally</I> so, or we could take the primary meaning of <I>l&igrave;</I> and say "profitable tools."  The statement thus could be about the fear of violence from weapons, or it could imply the general Taoist fear of novelty and wealth from productive technology.  An ambiguity would be characteristic of Taoism.  "The further novelties multiply":  Again, Taoism wants a simple, rural life.  "The better known the laws the edicts/The more thieves and robbers there are."  Taoism is not going to care much for laws (<img src="images/hiero/sch-leg.gif" align=middle>), and it is certainly true that the multiplication of laws in effect <I>creates</I> more crime.  The prisons today are full of people who have broken laws (mainly drug laws) that simply didn't exist a hundred years ago, while a great deal of litigation is about issues (e.g. over <a href="corrupt.htm">discrimination</a>) that would have been considered private matters even seventy years ago.

<li><a name="133"><img src="images/taote.gif" align=right>Verse 133:  "I am not meddlesome and the people prosper of themselves."

For discussion of <img src="images/hiero/pragma.gif" align=middle> as meaning "to serve," see the treatment at <I>Analects</I> <a href="confuciu.htm#pragma">VI:28</a>.  This principle suggests the "Tao of capitalism," since the principle of the free market is to <I>leave people alone</I> (<I>laissez-faire</I>), by which the "Invisible Hand" of Adam Smith (the <I>Tao</I>) will be able to create wealth for everyone.  Such a result would not necessarily be what Taoism had in mind:  "I am free from desire and the people of themselves become simple [like the uncarved block]" [fourth line at right]; but a free market economy, by created unprecedented wealth, does just the opposite.  Taoism wanted a simple, rural life, without "cleverness" or "novelties," but leaving people alone to become wealthy means that they <I><B>will</B></I> -- which produces a vast consumer market of "cleverness" and "novelties" far from simplicity.

A strikingly new version of the yin and yang imagery:  The yin side is now simply <I>life</I> and the yang <I>death</I>.  This is especially noteworthy because the identification does not persist:  Later Chinese tradition, even in religious Taoism, comes to associate <I>yang</I> with life and yin with <I>death</I>.

It takes from those who are in want in order to offer this to those who already have more than enough."  This could be interpreted in different ways, and might be thought to justify programs to "redistribute" income from the rich to the poor, i.e. from "those who already have more than enough" to "those who are in want."  However, political action to "redistribute" income commonly takes from those with less political influence to give to those with more, which means that "middle class entitlements," like Social Security and Medicare, vastly outweigh "lower class entitlements," like public housing and welfare.  Social Security and Medicare themselves tax the young, who vote less and are less wealthy, in order to pay the elderly, who are far wealthier, vote regularly, and are more politically active.  The "way of heaven" would then be to abolish all such political redistributions and allow the free market to do its Taoist "invisible hand" job of creating wealth for all.

Weapons, ships, and carts will be ready at hand, but apparently unused.  Whether the weapons are to be used, of course, may well depend on the actions of others.  Ships and carts, however, may be the instruments of peaceful trade and travel, activities that are here condemned.  "Yet the people of one state will grow old and die without having had any dealings with those of another."  This is much more extreme than even the Confucian dislike of trade and foreigners.  One of the four traditional Chinese <a href="key.htm#class">classes</a>, merchants [<img src="images/hiero/four-mrc.gif" align=middle>], would simply disappear in the Taoist ideal.

<P><a href="choustat.htm#sunzi">Sun Tzu</a> sounds the most like a Taoist when he counsels against frontal attacks.  One should direct one's army as though it were the supreme example of the Tao, water, <a href="elements.htm#china"><img src="images/hiero/water2.gif" align=middle border=0></a>.  Water overcomes obstacles by flowing around and undermining them.  The ideal battle for Sun Tzu is won before action is even joined.

<P>One of the most important pieces of advice in Sun Tzu is stated very briefly:  "[B]e sure to leave an opening for an army that is surrounded" [Victor H. Mair, <I>The Art of the War, Sun Zi's Military Methods</I>, Columbia University Press, 2007, p.104], or "When you surround an army leave an outlet free" [Lionel Giles, <I>Roots of Strategy, The 5 Greatest Military Classics of All Time</I>, edited by Brig. Gen. Thomas R. Phillips, 1940, Stackpole Books, 1985, p.40].  Sun Tzu does not explain <I>why</I> one should leave an opening.  The effect of it, however, we can see in the Battle of the River Saj&oacute; (or Mohi), fought by the <a href="mongol.htm#golden">Mongols</a> under the Kh&acirc;n Batu against King Bela IV of <a href="perifran.htm#mongol">Hungary</a> in 1241.  After some Hungarian success, the Mongols surrounded the Hungarian camp.  Leaving a gap in their encirclement, the Mongols tempted the Hungarians to flee, which they did, and could then be cut down on the run.

<P>Where we find an explanation of this practice is in the Roman strategist <a href="romania.htm#vegetius">Flavius Vegetius Renatus</a> (<I>De Re Militari</I>, Lieutenant John Clarke, <I>Roots of Strategy, The 5 Greatest Military Classics of All Time</I>, <I>op.cit.</I>, pp.65-175]):

<P><blockquote>T<font size=-1>HE</font> F<font size=-1>LIGHT OF AN</font> E<font size=-1>NEMY</font> S<font size=-1>HOULD</font> N<font size=-1>OT BE</font> P<font size=-1>REVENTED</font>, B<font size=-1>UT</font> F<font size=-1>ACILITATED</font>.  Generals unskilled in war think a victory incomplete unless the enemy are so straightened in their ground or so entirely surrounded by numbers as to have no possibility of escape.  But in such situations, where no hopes remain, fear itself will arm an enemy and despair inspires courage.  When men find they must inevitably perish, they willingly resolve to die with their comrades and with their arms in their hands.  The maxim of Scipio, that a <B>golden bridge</B> should be made for a flying enemy, has much been commended.  For when they have free room to escape they think of nothing but how to save themselves by flight, and the confusion becoming general, great numbers are cut to pieces.  The pursuers can be in no danger when the vanquished have thrown away their arms for greater haste.  In this case the greater the number of the flying army, the greater the slaughter. [p.164, boldface added]</blockquote>

<P>Nothing could so vividly describe the result of an action like that of the River Saj&oacute;.  The reference of the "golden bridge," however, has not always been understood in military history.  Thus, the Marshal Maurice de Saxe of France (1696-1750) in his "My Reveries Upon the Art of War" says:

<P><blockquote>The words of the proverb:  "A bridge of gold should be made for the enemy," is followed religiously.  This is false.  On the contrary, the pursuit should be pushed to the limit.  And the retreat which had appeared such a satisfactory solution will be turned into a route [<I>sic</I>].  A detachment of ten thousand men can destroy an army of one hundred thousand in flight.  Nothing inspires so much terror or occasions so much damage, for everything is lost. [Brig. Gen. Thomas R. Phillips, <I>op.cit.</I>, p.299]</blockquote>

<P>De Saxe apparently is thinking that the "bridge of gold" means that one should allow the enemy to escape.  He cannot have recently read Vegetius if he believed such a thing.  But he is clearly aware that a retreating enemy can well provide an opportunity for attack.  He does not express, however, as Vegetius does, under what circumstances a retreating enemy can be fruitfully attacked.  We return to Sun Tzu again, who says, "Do not pursue an enemy who simulates flight" [Lionel Giles, <I>op.cit.</I>, p.40].  An <I>orderly</I> retreat may be as difficult to attack as a resolute defense.  Vegetius sees opportunity when the retreat of the enemy is a flight in panic, which can be <I>induced</I> by providing the "bridge of gold" to an army already demoralized.  We must aways guard, however, against deception by an enemy who wants us to <I>think</I> that they are fleeing in panic.  This was how the <a href="islam.htm#umar">Arabs</a> defeated the <a href="romania.htm#heracli">Romans</a> at the Battle of Yarmuk in 636, delivering Syria and Palestine permanently into the hands of Isl&acirc;m.  The Arabs gave way and appeared to flee, but then they turned on the pursuing Romans, who had become disorganized in their own enthusiasm.  In more subtle fashion, Hannibal had given way before the Romans at <a href="hist-1.htm#carthage2">Cannae</a>, to lure them into a pocket, where they were slaughtered.

<P>The Taoist way of war is thus not so unique after all, and it even clarifies the value of Sun Tzu's advice when we compare it with strategists in Western military history.  We might say that Vegetius does a much better job of explaining Sun Tzu than Sun Tzu does.
