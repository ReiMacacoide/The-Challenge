Two Consuls, the principal Executive officers of the Roman Republic -- <B>Respublica Romana</B> -- were elected at Rome to yearly terms (sometimes we get substitutes or replacements, <I>suffecti</I>).  Roman dating, as that by <a href="archon.htm">Eponymous Archons</a> at Athens, was by these Consuls.  The list of Roman Consuls to 337 AD, the year of the death of Constantine, is given by E.J. Bickerman, <I>Chronology of the Ancient World</I> (Cornell University Press, 1968, 1982, pp.140-162).  After the foundation of Constantinople in 330, the tradition develops, irregularly, to associate one Consul with the new capital.

<P>Here, Consuls are only given for the Roman Republic, ending with 27 BC, when <B>Octavian</B> was granted the title <B>Augustus</B>, by which he is then known as the first of the Roman <a href="romania.htm#prince">Emperors</a>, although the title <I>Imperator</I> ("commander") was already used (for a military commander with both civil and military jurisdiction).  Nevertheless, the Consular office continued, until the reign of <a href="romania.htm#justin">Justinian</a>, as explained by Bickerman himself:

<P><center><table cellpadding=5 width=200>
<tr><td>The Romans dated by consuls until AD 537 when Justinian (<I>Novell.</I> 47) introduced the dating according to the regnal years of the emperors.  From 534 in the West and after 541 in the East, only the emperors held the consulship.  Yet, the dating by consuls continued to be used in Egypt until 611.  Accordingly, we have the complete list of consuls from Brutus and Collatinus, the founders of the Roman Republic in 509 BC, to Basilius in AD 541:  1,050 years. [p.69]</td></tr></table></center>

<P>While Bickerman may have the list to 541, he only gives it to 337.  Since his book is the chronology of the "ancient world," perhaps this explains why it wouldn't extend after 476, but that doesn't explain why it should already end at 337.  This certainly relfects a disinterest or a distaste for Late Antiquity, such as I have discussed <a href="decdenc1.htm">elsewhere</a>.  The foundation of Constantinople is one of the conventional dates for the beginning of "Byzantine" history.  The list of Consuls of the Roman Empire, or at least the Western Consuls at Rome right down "to Basilius," are now given on a <a href="JavaScript:popup('romconsl.htm','romeconsuls','resizable,scrollbars,menubar,location,width=425,height=600')" onMouseover="window.status='Click for the popup of Consuls of the Roman Empire';return true" onMouseout="window.status='';return true">popup page</a>.

<P>Bickerman's list gives the year in the <B>AD</B> (the Christian <I>Ann&ocirc; Domini</I>, "in the Year of the Lord") era and the year in the <B>AUC</B> era.  The latter I have discarded, since it was <I>not used</I>, as described by Bickerman himself:

<P><P><center><table cellpadding=5 width=200>
<tr><td>An era <I>ab urbe condita</I> (from the founding of the city of Rome) did not, in reality, exist in the ancient world, and the use of reckoning the years in this way is modern....

<P>The principal reason for not using the system <I>ab urbe condita</I> was that the age of the city was disputed... [p.77]</td></tr></table></center>

<P>Bickerman says that Cicero, Livy, and Diodorus identified the founding of the city with the 2nd year of the 7th Olympiad, as the chronology of the Olympiads had been constructed by Polybius.  The more familiar date now is the one hit upon by <B>Atticus</B>, Titus Pomponius Atticus (d.32 BC), in his <I>Liber annalis</I>.  This was <B>753 BC</B>, the <B>4th year of the 6th Olympiad</B>, and was then popularized by <B>Varro</B>, Marcus Terentius Varro (d.27 BC).  The year is now associated with Varro more than Atticus.

<P>Note that the dispute over the date of the founding of Rome, and the eventual popularity of one date, mirrors the similar problem over the <I>age of the world</I> in Jewish and Christian sacred <a href="calendar.htm#world">chronology</a>.  The Jewish and Byzantine Eras were actually used for dating, but the popular Christian chronology of Bishop Ussher, to 4004 BC, although figuring in the Scopes "Monkey Trial" of <a href="creation.htm">Darwinism</a>, was not.

<P><a name="names"><hr>

<P>Roman names ideally consisted of three parts, the <I>tria nomina</I>:  &nbsp;the <I>praen&ocirc;men</I>, the given name, the <I>n&ocirc;men</I>, the "gentile" name or name of the <I>gens</I> or clan, and the <I>cogn&ocirc;men</I>, the surname or family name (though this was sometimes missing, as with C. Flaminius, killed at the battle of Lake Trasimene against Hannibal in 217, and could also be more in the form of an epithet or personal name).

<P>Thus, the full name of Julius Caesar was <B>Gaius Iulius Caesar</B>, with the <I>praen&ocirc;men</I>, <I>n&ocirc;men</I>, and <I>cogn&ocirc;men</I>, respectively.  Today people would tend to think of "Julius" as the given name, but it was not, though the <I>n&ocirc;men</I> was often used for women as the equivalent, as with Augustus's daughter Julia.  Gaius had a prominent great-uncle, Sextus Julius Caesar, who, of course, could not be easily identified by calling him either "Julius" or "Caesar" alone.

<P>In the list of Consuls, there is another name that is given, the "filiation," or, as it would be called from Greek, the "<a href="greek.htm#note-22">patronymic</a>," the name of one's father.  This consists of the <I>praen&ocirc;men</I> of the father (in the genitive case) followed by <I>filius</I>, "son" (abbreviated <I>f.</I>).  The filiation is given between the <I>n&ocirc;men</I> and the <I>cogn&ocirc;men</I>.  Caesar's name, without abbreviations, thus could be Gaius Iulius <B>Gaii filius</B> Caesar.  Some extended filiations are given, as with C. Livius <B>M. Aemiliani f.</B> Drusus, Consul in 147.

<P>A name may end with various epithets, like <B>Africanus</B>, an <I>agn&ocirc;men</I>, also called a "surname," which can be legally granted in recognition of some service to Rome, or might accrue informally.  For instance, <B>Pompey the Great</B>, Cn. Pompeius Cn.f. Magnus, did not have a <I>cogn&ocirc;men</I>, but then acquired <I>Magnus</I>, "Great," as the equivalent.  One might expect this to have happened informally, but it was in fact legally granted by Sulla.

<P>The <I>praen&ocirc;men</I> is usually abbreviated in the table, as follows:

<P><center><table cellpadding=5 width=200>
<tr><td><ul>
<li>A. = Aulus
<li>Ap. = Appius
<li>C. = Gaius
<li>Cn. = Gnaeus
<li>Corn. = Cornelius
<li>D. = Decimus
<li>Fl. = Flavius
<li>K. = Kaeso
<li>L. = Lucius
<li>M. = Marcus
<li>M'. = Manius
<li>Mam. = Mamercus
<li>N. = Natus
<li>N. = Numerius
<li>Opet. = Opiter
<li>P. = Publius
<li>Post. = Postumus
<li>Proc. = Proculus
<li>Q. = Quintus
<li>Ser. = Servius
<li>Sex. = Sextus
<li>Sp. = Spurius
<li>T. = Titus
<li>Ti. = Tiberius
<li>Vop. = Vopiscus
</ul></td></tr></table></center>

<P>Thus, Caesar's name is actually listed as <B>C. Iulius C.f. Caesar</B>.  Augustus, a nephew of Caesar, and originally C. Octavius, but as a son by adoption, assumed exactly the same name, with the <I>agn&ocirc;men</I> <B>Octavianus</B>.  This is how he is listed as a Consul for the year 43.  Subsequently, however, he is listed as <B>Imp. Caesar Divi f.</B>, "Emperor Caesar, son of the Divine [Caesar]."

<P>For the year 43 Octavian is actually given as a <I>suffectus</I> (<I>Suff.</I>), a "substitute" Consul.

<P><hr>

<P>The first list of Consuls was apparently compiled around 300 BC, and undoubtedly contained a great deal of legendary material and speculative chronology.  As Bickerman says:

<P><P><center><table cellpadding=5 width=200>
<tr><td>The cornerstone of ancient Roman chronology was the capture of Rome by the Gauls, since this event was the earliest fact of Roman history mentioned and dated by contemporary Greek authors.  The date corresponded to 387/6 BC... Yet, the roman consular list indicated 382 BC.  In order to use the Greek synchronism, Diodorus twice gives the names of the same Roman eponyms... Livy reaches the date 387/6 by inserting a quinquennium of anarchy without the magistrates...  The <I>Fasti Capitolini</I> insert four years of dictators <I>sine consule</I> and in this way arrive at 391/0 as the date of the Gallic sack of Rome... [p.69-70]</td></tr></table></center>

<P>Nevertheless, histories usually give the sack of Rome as an unproblematic 390 BC, or perhaps 387 BC.

<P>In the 19th Century, we get a <a href="porno.htm">pornographic</a> bondage fantasy, below, of barbarian <a href="scotia.htm#celtic">Gauls</a> enjoying captive Roman women.  <a href="gender.htm#nietzsche">Nietzsche</a> doubtless would approve.

<P><a name="cincinnatus"><hr>

<P>The purpose of dividing executive power between two Consuls for annual terms was to prevent the concentration and accumulation of power and the restoration of something like the monarchy.  Nevertheless, times of crisis might call for greater authority and unified command.

<P>Consequently, a Dictator could be appointed, for a term of six months.  The archetype of what a Dictator should be like, with legendary embelishments, was <B>L. Quinctius L.f. Cincinnatus</B>, who was supposed to have been appointed in 458 and 439.  Cincinnatus had been impoverished and was simply farming his own land.  The story is that the messengers from the Senate found him working on his farm, dirty and undressed.  They asked him to put on his toga and then informed him that he had been appointed Dictator.  This scene is clearly cherished by the historian <B>Livy</B>, Titus Livius, who relates it thus:

<P><center><table cellpadding=5 width=200><tr><td>Now I would solicit the particular attention of those numerous people who imagine that money is everything in this world, and that rank and ability are inseparable from wealth:  &nbsp;let them observe that Cincinnatus, the one man in whom Rome reposed all her hope of survival, was at that moment working a little three-acre farm (now known as the Quinctian meadows) west of the Tiber, just opposite the spot where the shipyards are today.  A mission from the city found him at work on his land -- digging a ditch, maybe, or ploughing.  Greetings were exchanged, and he was asked -- with a prayer for the god's blessing on himself and his country -- to put on his toga and hear the Senate's instructions.  This naturally surprised him, and, asking if all were well, he told his wife Racilia to run to their cottage and fetch his toga.  The toga was brought, and wiping the grimy sweat from his hands and face he put it on; at once the envoys from the city saluted him, with congratulations, as Dictator, invited him to enter Rome, and informed him of the terrible danger of Minucius's army.  [Livy, <I>The Early History of Rome</I>, translated by Aubrey de S&eacute;lincourt, Penguin Books, 1960, p.197 -- "God's" changed to "the god's," <I>ed.</I>]</td></tr></table></center>

<P>This resonated in the 18th century for everyone who believed in Republican government, limited government, by honest private, disinterested citizens.  That is how Cincinnati, Ohio, got its name.  At the end of the 19th century, we have the very eerie repetition of this scene when <a href="rand.htm#cassatt">Alexander Cassatt</a> was offered the Presidency of the Pennsylvania Railroad.

<P><hr>

<P>The office of Dictator itself contained the potential for danger.  Although the end of the Republic is usually dated to 27 BC, when Octavian became Augustus, a key date certainly would be 44 BC, when Caesar was made Dictator <I>for life</I>.  A lifetime office is not a Republican office.

<P>But Caesar did not leap directly to dictatorship.  He could only do that because he had been granted <I>imperium</I> in Gaul, which meant he possessed both military and civil plenipotentiary powers.  Granting this kind of authority undermined the whole prinicple of the Roman Republic that executive power should be divided and temporary, in the person of the Consuls.  So Caesar ended up with his own personal kingdom and his own personal army, independent of the Consuls and the Senate.  Then his enemies began <I>telling him</I> that he would be prosecuted when his command was ended and he returned to Rome.  This was just <I>asking</I> for him to rebel, even while his army was more formidable than any other Roman army in existence at the time.  This involved great folly, compounded atop the original <I>imperium</I>, and it is not surprising that it lead directly to Caesar's dictatorship, and then to the Empire.

<P>Of course, after his dictatorship was established, Caesar was then assassinated, but his friends and his heir, Octavian, defeated the Republicans.  Augustus, indeed, did not assume or create a Dictatorship for life (refusing Dictatorship or Consulship for life in 22 BC), maintaining a fiction of Republican government, but he did become Tribune for life, and his informal constructions gradually solidified into the lifetime office.  Indeed, Augustus was given <I>imperium</I> similar to Caesar's, and this made him <I>Imperator</I>, "commander," now "Emperor" -- the title of the new monarchical office he created.

<hr>

<P>Rule by one man had threatened earlier.  The first real threat may have been <B>Marius</B>, C. Marius C.f., who reformed and enlarged the army, enrolling landless <I>proletarii</I>, and was then able to help defeat the revolt of <a href="romania.htm#numidia">Jugurtha</a> (112-105).  Marius was elected to five successive Consulships, 104-100, even though it was supposed to be illegal for anyone to succeed himself in the office (or serve again for ten years).  Eventually, he seized Rome by force in 87, driving out Sulla.  But then he died of natural causes the next year.

<P><B>Sulla</B> himself, L. Cornelius L.f. Sulla Felix (<I>felix</I> = "happy" or "lucky," an apparently informal <I>agn&ocirc;men</I>), was the next threat.  He was made Dictator in 82 and continued in the office until he resigned in 80 or 79, dying in 78.

<P>One of Sulla's supporters, <B>Pompey</B> would have represented the next threat of one-man rule, but he had to contend with powerful rivals like <B>Crassus</B>, M. Licinius P.f. Crassus, and then <B>Caesar</B> himself.  Crassus was killed by the <a href="iran.htm#parthian">Parthians</a>, and Caesar defeated Pompey in 48 BC.  A fleeing Pompey was then obligingly executed by the advisors of the child King Ptolemy XIII of Egypt.  Caesar was not pleased with this and found an ally in the rebellious Queen and sister of the King, <a href="hist-1.htm#text-9">Cleopatra</a>, with whom, as we know, Caesar ushered in the height of his power.

<P>The last century of the Republic thus looks like little more than a continuing civil war to see which individual would assume the equivalent of a permanent dictatorship.  Why this should have happened is a good question for any kind of elective government.

<P><a name="fasces"><hr>

<P><img src="history/fasces2.gif" align=right>

The <I>fasces</I>, "bundles," axes tied with red ribbon in a bundle of birch (or elm) rods, were symbols of the <I>imperium</I>, "command," the power and authority of the Roman State and of its offices, each carried by a <I>lictor</I> who accompanied officials.

<P>These were symbols of Etruscan Kings, and originally the axe might be double-bladed, the <I>labrys</I>, familiar from the Aegean world and which apparently gave its name to the great palace at <a href="euthyph.htm#labyrinth">Knossos</a>, the <I>Labyrinthos</I>.

<P>Twelve <I>fasces</I> were carried (by twelve <I>lictores</I>) for the Roman Kings, a number inherited by the Consuls.  Other officials rated their own number of <I>fasces</I>, as follows, though the display of them in Rome itself was often limited.

<P><center><table cellpadding=5 width=200>
<tr><td><ul>
<li>Dictators, 24
<li>Consuls, 12
<li>Praetors, Proconsuls, 6
<li>Legates, 5
<li>Priests, 1
</ul></td></tr></table></center>

<P>Although they continued to be used for the Emperors -- originally 12, after Domitian, 24 -- by the 18th century they were symbols more of Republican than of Imperial government.  As such, <I>fasces</I> turn up in American, French, Swiss, and other modern Republican iconography.

<P>However, <a href="francia.htm#modern">Mussolini</a>, seeking his own version of modern Roman power, liked the symbolism more of power and unity than of Republicanism, and he adopted the <I>fasces</I> to symbolize his own political party.  This made the party the <I><B>Fascist</B></I> Party, which then contributed its name to related political ideologies, which in the simplest terms would be totalitarian, collectivist, and nationalistic.

<P>Now, a form of collectivism, of subordinating the individual to the state, is not alien to Roman sensibility, as considered <a href="decdenc1.htm#note-1">elsewhere</a>.  While the power of the Emperors would have been to Mussolini's liking, the purposes of Roman Republican government, however, dividing and limiting authority, were alien to "Fascist" purposes, which were for unlimited and absolute government -- an ideal of government unfortunately all too congenial to many in <a href="satan.htm">modern politics</a>, and as characteristic of the Left as of the far Right, sometimes making it hard to distinguish between them.

<P><hr>

<P>The saying is that Rome conquered the world in self-defense.  If all one does is read Roman sources, this is what it sounds like.  The dynamic of this is simple enough.  If your neighbors are giving you trouble, defeat them.  Right from the beginning, however, the Roman viewed disputes with neighbors as something like betrayal and began to conquer them instead of just setting them back.  But they also began to truly <I>absorb</I> neighbors, not always giving them the same rights as Roman citizens, but giving them something, and benefiting from their participating in the Roman army.   Since absorbing a neighbor means that one acquires the neighbors of <I>their</I> far borders, the process begins over again.

<P>By 301 BC, Rome, after a very long process, had risen from a city state to dominate Latium and then Campania.  In the South of Italy the Romans faced Greek city states.  They called the area <I>Magna Graecia</I>, "Great Greece," but got their own word for the Greeks, which modern Western European languages still use, from some tribe in the area.

<P>By 270, the Romans have absorbed Etruria (Tuscany) and have defeated and absorbed the Greek cities in Italy, despite the best effort of Pyrrhus, King of <a href="hist-1.htm#epirus">Epirus</a>.  Pyrrhus contributed an enduring phrase to discourse.  Although he won his first battles against the Romans, the slaughter was so great, he commented that one more such victory and he would be ruined.  Hence, a "Pyrrhic Victory," where one might as well have lost, because of the cost.

<P>Carthage was the Great Power of the Western Mediterranean in these days, and relations with Rome had initially been friendly.  But once the two powers found themselves strategically adjacent, Rome's attitude changed.  Roman diplomacy towards Carthage became touchy and demanding, with a simmering hostility.  The disputes were over Sicily, where Rome had no possessions, but of course any Greek cities appealing to Rome for help could become "allies."  Carthage put up with this for a while, but the perhaps inevitable war broke out in 264.

<P>This was the First Punic (i.e. Phoenican) War, which lasted a punishing 20 years (264-241).  <a href="archon.htm#syracuse">Syracuse</a> got caught in the middle, and eventually went over to the Romans, thereby preserving some autonomy.  The land campaign was a tough one, but the decisive actions came at sea.  Carthage was a <a href="thalasso.htm">thalassocracy</a>, and the Romans could only contend by building a navy.  The initial tactics, since the Romans were not knowledgeable seafarers, where to grapple and board Carthaginians ships.  Until the Carthaginians could counter such tactics, the Romans got an advantage and experience at sea.  Their inexperience, however, told several times when Roman fleets were caught by storms at sea.  Storms ended up doing more damage than the Carthaginians.

<P>Carthage was at a disadvantage in that the Carthaginian state did not have the manpower of the Roman, relying on allies and mercenaries; and since the state was essentially a commercial one, there was a certain lack of enthusiasm for the investment in military power that would have been necessary.  Rome won Sicily, and then rubbed in its victory by annexing Corsica and Sardinia in 237.

<P>By 220 Carthage itself had acquired new resources.  <B>Hamilcar Barca</B>, the Carthaginian commander in Sicily during the First Punic War, prepared for the future by moving to Spain and enlarging Carthaginian possessions there.  He died, but his son <a href="hist-1.htm#carthage2"><B>Hannibal</B></a> planned on what would need to be done to deal with Rome.  Once Rome acquired "allies" in Spain and began making demands, Hannibal knew it was time.

<P>What Hannibal did was to take his seasoned army from Spain and to march over the Alps into Italy, initiated the Second Punic War (218-201).  This is the most serious threat that Rome ever faced to the growth of its power.  It didn't help that Hannibal turned out to be one of the greatest generals in all of history.  For centuries thereafter, Roman mothers could frighten their children with, "Hannibal is at the gates!"

<P>In three years, Hannibal won three crushing victories and killed two Roman Consuls.  The third victory, at Cannae (in 216), all but annihilated four Legions, enveloping them on each flank and then surrounding them.  This has become the ideal battle of military history, though rarely matched.  Hannibal, however, labored against three insuprable disadvantages:  &nbsp;(1) Rome had the manpower resources to recover quickly from the defeats; (2) Hannibal did not have a siege train and was unable to take or seriously threaten Roman cities; and (3) his hope that his victories would inspire defections from the cities of Latium, Campania, and Magna Graecia proved generally unfounded.  His prospective allies knew what Rome was like, what Roman vengeance could be like, and Hannibal seemed to have little to offer them by way of certainties or sureties.

<P><a name="fabius">While Hannibal endured no real defeats in Italy, the strategy of <B>Q. Fabius Maximus Verrucosus</B>, made dictator in 217, was to avoid battle. This made him <I>Cunctator</I>, "Delayer."  Repudiation of this, and a determination to come to grips with Hannibal, simply led to Cannae.  Fabius was vindicated, and now he has contributed another phrase to modern discourse, "Fabian tactics."  This has even ended up in political history, as "Fabian Socialism," the idea that socialism could be instituted, not by an abrupt Marxist revolution, but through piecemeal and incremental victories.  As a device to institute socialism, not only was this quite successful, but it <a href="rand.htm#modern">continues</a> to be successful even when everyone has forgotten, or at least doesn't admit, what the purpose of the process is -- and even the word "socialism" is avoided -- although, remarkably, with people literally hungry and being shot under socialism in <a href="newspain.htm#venezuela">Venezuela</a>, American socialists, forgetting all their admiration for Venezuela and the <a href="newspain.htm#cuba">Cuban</a> dictatorship, are somehow encouraged, since 2016, to make their idiotic proposals and openly proclaim their clueless commitment.

<P><a name="scipio">While Hannibal was largely neutralized in Italy, Rome continued to dominate the sea and Roman strategy began to focus on conquering Spain in Hannibal's rear.  At first this had its ups and downs, against Hannibal's brother Hasdrubal, and then seemed to be going very badly when the brothers <B>P. Cornelius L.f. Scipio</B> and <B>Cn. Cornelius L.f. Scipio Calvus</B> were both killed there in 211.  They were immediately succeeded by the former's son, <B>P. Cornelius P.f. Scipio</B> -- who would become <B>Africanus</B>.

<P>Scipio captured New Carthage (<I>Carthago Nova</I>, Cartagena), Hamilcar's capital, in 209.  Hasdrubal, defeated in 207, left to join Hannibal in Italy.  <B>C. Claudius Ti.f. Nero</B> secretly took his army away from watching Hannibal and joined <B>M. Livius M.f. Salinator</B> at the River Metaurus to defeat and kill Hasdrubal.  The head of Hannibal's brother was then thrown into his camp.  This must have been the most bitter of moments for Hannibal, who now knew that he could expect no more from the resources of Spain -- all his father's work lost.

<P>Wrapping things up in Spain, Scipio return to Rome and then led an invasion of Africa itself in 204.  This had been tried in the First Punic War and had not gone well.  Now Scipio tempted over the Carthagian ally, Masinissa of <a href="romania.htm#numidia">Numidia</a>.  The Numidians had supplied much of the best Carthaginian cavalry.  Now, as Hannibal at last returned to Africa to deal with the threat, this cavalry was turned against him when he finally met decisive defeat at Zama in 202.

<P>Carthage then repudiated Hannibal and the War was settled expeditiously.  Carthage was left with a rump African state, with few rights to pursue her own policies.  Rome became the dominant, almost the only, state in the Western Mediterranean.

<P><a name="syracuse">A sad and ugly episode of the War was when <B>M. Claudius M.f. Marcellus</B> took <a href="archon.htm#syracuse">Syracuse</a> (which had switched sides to Carthage) in 212.  <B>Archemides</B>, probably the greatest mathematician of antiquity, had used his powers of invention to create engines that helped withstand the Roman siege for three years.  Before the city fell, Marcellus instructed his men to respect Archemides, but the great man was killed, for various legendary reasons, when a Roman soldier found him.

<P>By 192 Rome had defeated <a href="hist-1.htm#macedon">Macedonia</a> (Second Macedonian War, 200-196) in revenge for siding, for a while, with Carthage.  <B>T. Quinctius T.f. Flamininus</B> defeated Philip V at Cynoscelphalae (197) and proclaimed the "Freedom of Greece" at the Isthmian Games (196).  This made Rome a player in the Aegean, and naturally it made enemies of anyone on the hither shore.  This turned out to be the <a href="hist-1.htm#text-8">Seleucid</a> King Antiochus III, the Great, who had marched to India and apparently restored the power of his Kingdom.

<P>Antiochus, however great, was no match for the Romans.  At Magnesia in 190, Antiochus was defeated by Scipio Africanus, who allowed the glory to go to his brother, <B>L. Cornelius P.f. Scipio</B>, as nominal commander.  L. Cornelius was then honored with the <I>agn&ocirc;men</I> <B>Asiaticus</B> or <B>Asiagenus</B>.  The Seleucids ceded Anatolia north and west of the Taurus, never to return.  The Romans rewarded <a href="hist-1.htm#pergamum">Pergamum</a> with most of this territory.

<P><hr>

<P>By 145 two major changes had occured.  The Third Punic War (149-146) had ended with the annihilation of Carthage.  This had been urged on by <B>M. Porcius M.f. Cato</B>, better known as <B>Cato the Elder</B>, who always ended his speeches with a ringing, <I>Delenda est Carthago</I>, "Carthage must be destroyed."  It was, under the direction of <B>P. Cornelius P.f. Scipio Africanus Aemilianus</B>, adopted as a grandson of Scipio Africanus, accompanied by the Greek historian <B>Polybius</B>.  At the same time, Greece was conquered by <B>L. Mummius L.f.</B> (Fourth Macedonian War, 149-146).  Corinth was brutally sacked in an example of Roman revenge.  Meanwhile, <a href="iran.htm#parthian">Parthia</a>, independent since 248, tossed the Seleucids out of eastern Iran by 185.  And <a href="romania.htm#judea">Judaea</a> had thrown off Seleucid control by 164.

<P>By 74 BC, when Cyrene was made a province, Asia, meaning western Anatolia, had also been annexed, when the lands of <a href="hist-1.htm#pergamum">Pergamum</a> were <I>willed</I> to Rome in 133 by the last King, Attalus III.  Cilicia was annexed after a campaign against pirates by <B>M. Antonius M.f.</B> in 102. Cilician pirates had kept Rome well supplied with slaves.

<P><a name="spartacus"><hr>

<P>The existence of so many slaves led to notable slave revolts, in Sicily up to 100, and especially the huge revolt of <B>Spartacus</B> coming in 73.  Warfare was carried on by Marius against the revolt of <a href="romania.htm#numidia">Jugurtha</a> and invasions by the Celtic (not German) tribes of the Teutones and Cimbri.  The Social War (91-88) led to Italian provincials being given full Roman citizenship.

<P>A different sort of conflict was between the Popular and the Senatorial parties at Rome itself, with Marius for the former and Sulla emerging for the latter.  Sulla was given command to deal with Mithridates III of <a href="hist-1.htm#pontus">Pontus</a>, who turned the Black Sea into a Pontic lake, overran Anatolia, and invaded Greece (First Mithridatic War, 88-85).  It came down to Civil War between Marius and Sulla, with Marius in possession of Rome in 87.  But then he died the next year.  Sulla and the Senate took control.  Sulla then had to deal with Mithridates again (Second Mithridatic War, 83-82).  When Sulla died in 78, his political heir was Pompey.

<P>Spartacus defeated several Roman armies, including that of the Consul <B>C. Cassius L.f. Longinus</B> at Mutina in 72.  He was defeated by Crassus in 71 and crucified with his entire army along the Appian Way.

<P>The shadow of Spartacus, however, looms larger in modern political history than in Roman.  The Communists who attempted a revolution in Berlin in 1919, led by Rosa Luxemburg, were the "Spartacists," seeing workers through <a href="marx.htm">Marxist</a> theory as slaves under Capitalism.  This Communist connection continued much later with the movie <I>Spartacus</I> (1960), whose screenplay was written by Dalton Trumbo, a man who had been an active member of the Communist Party USA, was blacklisted after being found in Contempt of Congress, but then was given screen credit by Kirk Douglas, a star and producer of the movie, breaking the blacklist for the first time (it had been an agreement among Hollywood producers, with no legal force).

<P>While Trumbo wrote under a pseudonym during the blacklist, hardly even suffering professionally, and of course was not shipped off to a Gulag or shot the way similar dissidents in his beloved Soviet Union were, he <a href="variety.htm">continues</a> to be celebrated as a martyr by the people who don't want to admit how bad <a href="rand.htm#essential">Josef Stalin</a> was or who, more disturbingly, <a href="rand.htm#modern">still promote</a> forms of collectivism and political correctness that differ little from Soviet principles.

<P>Note well:  &nbsp;Trumbo was not penalized for his opinions or for free speech -- he never exercised free speech by honestly voicing his opinions in public.  His very success and celebrity were a joke on capitalism and clueless liberals.  Meanwhile, Leon Trotsky had famously argued that slave labor in the Soviet Union was simply the workers enslaving themselves for the sake for the Revolution.  And was therefore "voluntary."  Trumbo could well have laughed about this, but Spartacus probably would not have.

<P>By 44, when Caesar was assassinated, the outlines of the future were in place.  <B>L. Licinius L.f. Lucullus</B> had been left by Sulla to fight Mithridates, which he did successfully.  But his army didn't like him, and in 66 he was replaced by Pompey, who then destroyed Mithridates and imposed a Roman settlement on Anatolia, Syria, and Palestine (67-63).  Local autonomous states were allowed to remain, but it is revealing that several of these rulers sported names like <I>Philorh&ocirc;maios</I>, "Lover of Rome."

<P>Pompey enjoyed a unique opportunity in history, when he took Jerusalem in 63.  According to <B>Josephus</B> (Joseph ben Matthias or Flavius Josephus):

<P><P><center><table cellpadding=5 width=200>
<tr><td>Among the disasters of that time nothing sent such a shudder through the nation as the exposure by aliens of the Holy Place, hitherto screened from all eyes.  Pompey and his staff went into the Sanctuary, which no one was permitted to enter but the high priest, and saw what it contained -- the lampstand and the lamps, the table, the libation cups and censers, all of solid gold, and a great heap of spices and sacred money totalling &pound;2,000,000.  Neither on this nor on any other of the sacred treasures did he lay a finger, and only one day after the capture he instructed the custodians to purify the Temple and perform the normal sacrifices. [<I>The Jewish War</I>, translated by G.A. Williamson. Penguin, 1959, p.41]</td></tr></table></center>

<P>Noteworthy in Joseph's description of the contents of the Sanctuary is the absence of the Ark of the Convent, whose fate is discussed <a href="notes/newking.htm#22">elsewhere</a>.

<P><a name="caesar"><hr>

<P><B>Julius Caesar</B> began his career as an adherent of Marius's popular party.  However, Caesar allied with Pompey and Crassus in the First Triumvirate (60).  This enabled him to win command in Gaul.  "Cisalpine" Gaul, in northern Italy, was already Roman.  "Transalpine" Gaul, beyond the Alps, he conquered from 58 to 51.  This gave him a large and loyal army, with which he invaded Italy in 49, when he crossed the Rubicon River, the boundary of his command.

<P>By 44 BC, he had defeated Pompey (at Pharsalus, 48), dallied with Cleopatra, married her as a second wife (rather shocking to the Romans), and consolidated his position as <I>de facto</I> monarch.  This was the Roman Empire in most essentials, though disposing of final opposition and the definitive forms of Imperial power had to be engineered by Augustus, who also had to defeat Caesar's own friend and adherent, M. Antonius M.f. -- <B>Marc Anthony</B>, who famously succeeded Caesar in the arms of Cleopatra.

<P>The cause of the Republican assassins of Caesar ended at the battle of Philippi in 42.  Most notable among the assassins was <B>Brutus</B>, Marcus Iunius Brutus, "the noblest Roman of them all."  Although Brutus's name meant "heavy" or "immovable," and was used to mean dull or stupid, and is now used to mean brutal ("You brute!" -- indeed, "brutal" is just the adj. <I>brutalis</I> from <I>brutus</I>), it was a <I>cogn&ocirc;men</I> of the <I>gens</I> Iunius and recalls the name of the first Consul of the Republic, <B>L. Iunius M.f. Brutus</B>.

<P>Brutus was widely respected for his conscientiousness, integrity, and patriotism -- though <B>Cicero</B> thought him guilty of extortion.  He joined Pompey but was pardoned by Caesar after Pharsalus.  His adherence to the plot against Caesar gave it most of its moral weight.  When Caesar saw that Brutus was among his attackers on the Ides of March, he reportedly lost heart.  <B>Suetonius</B>, C. Suetonius Tranquillus ["The Deified Julius," <I>Lives of the Caesars</I>], reports that Caesar said nothing during the attack, "though some have written" that he said to Brutus, <img src="images/greek/kai.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/su-g.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/teknon.gif" align=middle>; <I>ka&igrave; s&ugrave; t&eacute;knon?</I> "And you, child?" in Greek [Loeb Classical Library, <I>Suetonius</I>, Volume I, Harvard, 1913, 1998, p.140-141 -- Shakespeare puts it, loosely, in Latin, <I>Et tu, Brute?</I>].

<P>This phrase, among other things, continues to fuel speculation that Brutus was actually Caesar's own natural son, a twist that puts the whole business in an even more tragic light than it already has.  Although driven out of Rome by riots, in 43 the Senate itself rewarded Brutus with a proconsular command in the Balkans.  Nevertheless, the matter would be settled by force, and after the defeat by Anthony and Octavian at Philippi, Brutus committed suicide.  The <B>Roman Republic</B> thus may be said to have ended with a Iunius Brutus the way it had begun with a Iunius Brutus.

<P><hr>

<P>So, we must ask, what went wrong with the Roman Republic?  From Polybius to <a href="machiav.htm">Machiavelli</a> and beyond, it was admired as a system of government, and it did have a good run, but in the end it unquestionably failed.  What happened?

<P><center><table cellpadding=5 border=0 width=210><tr><td><center><a href="plato.htm#note"><img src="images/gov-3.gif" border=0></a></center></td></tr></table></center>

<P><a href="plato.htm#note">Machiavelli</a>, in a tradition from the Greeks to the present, thought that that the Roman Republic worked because of a mixture of institutions, designed to correct each other and limit the abuses that various pure forms of government would have.  Thus, he believed that Monarchy alone led to Tyranny, Aristocracy alone let to Oligarchy, and Democracy alone led to Anarchy.  The Republic included a (limited) Monarchical power in the Consuls, Aristocratic power in the Senate, and Democratic power in the Tribunes and other institutions of the Plebs.  We have other features, such as the custom for most of the Republic that one Consul would be from the Patrician/Senatorial class, while the other would be a Pleb.

<P>Since, for at least the last century, most trendy political opinion has despised the principles of limited government and naively imagined that the more democracy the better, most recent judgment about the Roman Republic would be that it was insufficiently democratic.  Indeed, a great deal of the political conflict through the whole history of the Republic was in the direction of greater democracy, of greater power for the Plebs; and for the last century, from Marius to Caesar, there was a virtual, and sometimes very real, civil war between Senatorial and Popular factions.

<P>That was perhaps initiated by the two <B>Gracchi</B> brothers, <B>Ti. Sempronius Gracchus</B> (Tribune 133) and <B>C. Sempronius Gracchus</B> (Tribune 123 & 122).  A land reform bill, trying to redistribute agricultural holdings to small farmers, instead of their being worked by slaves for landlords, got Tiberius lynched by Senatorial opponents.  Gaius continued with other democratizing proposals but also provoked, for the time being, successful opposition.  Their cause, however, continued and would be championed, not always consistently, by Marius and Caesar.

<P>The trouble with viewing this history as a simple Aristocracy vs. Democracy morality play is that in winning, the leader of the Popular faction, Julius Caesar, did not usher in utopian Democracy but simply dictatorship and then a very durable Monarchy.  Disturbingly, this is no less than what <a href="plato.htm">Plato</a> would have predicted for the outcome of democratization.

<P><hr>

<P>The key to all this is the prinicple of <a href="rent.htm">rent-seeking</a>, the desire to live off one's capital, off the labor of others, or off pseudo-property created by political fiat (e.g. monopolies, unnecessary offices, etc.).  With the cynicism of politicians, this is obvious.  Even uncynical politicians, who may be above mere power seeking, inevitably pass from the scene and are rapidly replaced by more mercenary and venal successors.

<P>Roman politicians are rarely either purely idealistic or completely cynical.  Whether someone like Caesar thought he was doing good or was simply out for himself is a good question.  They were rarely unwilling to employ the support of the opposition if circumstances warranted or allowed it.

<P>None of this is suprising.  More importantly, however, is the fact that democracy can also easily become a form of rent-seeking, with politicians promising benefits in general.  The triumph of Caesar and the Empire depended, in a sense, on the essential tendency of democracy, even if the forms and functions of democracy were overriden and gradually eliminated.  The means of this triumph can be summed up in a familiar phrase:  &nbsp;<B>Panem et Circenses</B>, "Bread and Circuses."  Free food and free entertainment.

<P>The population of Rome, and later of Constantinople, was favored with a free ration -- one reason why Augustus kept Egypt, with its agricultural productivity, as his personal possession.  This meant that large parts of the populations of the metropolitan cities of the Roman Empire didn't need to work much for a living and were provided with something else to do.  The loss of productivity, creativity, and enterprise can hardly be imagined.

<P>The migration of power and intiative <I>out of Rome</I> itself, however, does not surprise.  The state was much better off once that happened, and the simple <a href="decdenc1.htm#reed">conclusion</a> that Rome "fell" because of the corruption of "bread and circuses" is falsified by the actually survival, not the "fall," of the Empire -- something serious historians, and not just superficial writers, often forget.  The subsequent loss of North Africa and then Egypt, the breadbaskets of the Empire, eventually ended the possibility of free rations -- though, at the same time, such reductions in territory greatly limited the resources available for recovery.

The institutions under which this all happened, however admired by Machiavelli or others, obviously allowed for their degeneration.  The principles were not wrong, but their weaknesses can be identified.  When military commands were political offices, the danger of a successful general, with loyal troops, using his army for his own political purposes became very great.  Caesar could cross the Rubicon because his men were willing to obey illegal orders and because there was no army or commander his equal in his way.

<P>In comparison to such a general, who might hold a command for years, the power of the legal Executives of the state, the Consuls, was paltry.  With this in mind, one understands why the President of the <a href="presiden.htm">United States</a>, in office for a substantial four years, is Constitutionally the Commander-in-Chief over armed forces whose own tradition is apolitical.  The political appointment of generals, especially in the Civil War, has existed in American history, but successful generals, from the Civil War on, have tended to be career military professionals.  Generals dissatisfied with political decisions concerning them, like Robert E. Lee, Joseph Stillwell, or Douglas McArthur, might complain, but would end up doing nothing worse than resigning.  Also, a modern army is so dependent on its logistical support, ultimately back to civilian sources, that no general really commands an independent force.

<P><a href="presiden.htm#3">Thomas Jefferson</a> said that when he was young, he and his friends used to say, "Where annual election ends, tyranny begins."  He was unhappy with how long the term of the President was, was appalled at the term of a Senator (six years), but was terrified that the President could be elected over and over again.  What frightened him so was the example of <a href="perifran.htm#valois">Poland</a>, where the election of the Kings of Poland had come entirely under the control of foreign powers.  As it happened, for more than the first century of American history, all the Presidents who might have successfully run for a third term -- Washington, Jefferson, Madison, Monroe, Jackson, and Grant -- declined to do so.  The precedent of Washington, who could easily have been President, or King, for Life, came to be viewed as morally binding.

<P><img src="history/fasces2.gif" align=right>
Thus, the <B>Julius Caesar</B> of American history was no general but a President, the one who broke with Washington's precedent (literally becoming President for Life), and the one who turned government into a promise of ever increasing benefits, rations, and subsidies.  This was <a href="presiden.htm#32">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>, and the damage done to American government is still evident, not just in the rent-seeking practices that now overwhelm political life, but in the respect paid to Roosevelt by both Democrats and Republicans.  Neither Party intends to reverse the principle, ennunciated in their day by Hamilton and rejected by Jefferson and Madison, but embraced by Roosevelt, that the United States Government can tax and spend money for any purpose, as long as this can be construed as promoting the "general welfare."  Free benefits for everyone would certainly produce a kind of "general welfare," except for the effects produced similar to the <I>Panem et Circenses</I>.  Again the damage to productivity, creativity, and enterprise can only be vaguely estimated, though the decline in all of these in countries, like <a href="francia.htm#5rep">France</a>, where taxation and welfare provisions are much greater than in the United States, is obvious to anyone who cares to look.  While dictatorship is not an immediate threat, we already see one interesting effect, where aggitation for more democracy and honest elections has led to a law, passed by Congress, approved by the <a href="presiden.htm#43">President</a>, and allowed by the Supreme Court, that <I>prohibits criticism of candidates for federal office</I> in advertisements purchased by advocacy groups.  This grotesquely abridges the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, and is rather obviously motivated, like most campaign "reform" laws, by the desire to protect politicians from criticism.  Avenues thus open to real tyranny and perhaps even to real Caesars, leaving us with no confidence that modern Democracies, or even the <a href="presiden.htm">Great Republic</a> itself, might not go the way of the <B>Respublica Romana</B>.

<P><a name="cato">As Caesar was rising to power, one of his most vocal critics was <B>Cato the Younger</B>, M. Procius Cato.  Cato originally opposed all the Triumvirs; but as hope for withstanding Caesar focused on Pompey, he threw his lot with that faction.  Cato ended up holding Utica in North Africa (hence the informal <I>agn&ocirc;men</I> "Uticensis") under Q. Caecilius Q.f. Metellus Pius Scipio (Consul with Pompey in 52), who fled there after Pharsalus.  Caesar invaded North Africa in 46 and defeated the Pompeian forces at Thapsus.  Metellus and Cato both committed suicide.  Cato's defense of the Republic was remembered in the British <a href="conserv.htm">Whig</a> politics of the 18th century.  Joseph Addison (1672-1719, admired more than <a href="locke.htm">Locke</a> by <a href="hume.htm">Hume</a>) wrote a play, <I>Cato: A Tragedy</I>, in 1713:

<P><center><table cellpadding=5 width=200>
<tr><td>While Cato lives, Caesar will blush to see<br>
Mankind enslaved, and be ashamed of empire.<br>
[Act IV, scene iv]</td></tr></table></center>

<P>This was followed by a series of 138 letters under the pseudonym "Cato," published by John Trenchard and Thomas Gordon, between 1720 and 1723.  These <I>Cato's Letter</I> were reprinted many times, in Britain and in America, and played a large part, after the pattern of John Locke's natural law and natural rights justification of the Glorious Revolution (1688), in the formulation of the ideology of the American Revolution.  Trenchard died in 1723; and Gordon, who did not die until 1750, threw his lot, a bit like Cato himself, with a particular political faction.  The Whig Party of Sir Robert Walpole (considered the first <a href="perifran.htm#prime">Prime Minister</a> of England), however, was rather more suitable than the faction of Pompey the Great.  Today, both Cato himself and the <I>Cato's Letters</I> are remembered in the work of the <a href="http://www.cato.org/"><B>Cato Institute</B></a>, whose efforts on behalf of limited, Jeffersonian, and Constitutional government are occasionally even noticed in Washington.<br clear=right>
