<P>I find it a little disturbing that Rhoda Koening ("Rude Britannia", <font color=red>T</font>WQ, no. 20) attributes the growth of bad manners in Britain entirely to "materialism."  Back when the UK suffered from laissez-faire capitalism, it grew into one of the most polite and considerate societies ever.  When the Labor Party took over in 1945, class envy and an entitlement mentality began to take over.  By the time Mrs. Thatcher came to power, Britain was being called the "Sick Man of Europe<font color=red>[,].</font>"  <font color=red>[and]</font> English soccer fans had become the terror of the sport.

<P>Those developments, I would say, were the result of socialism, not of "consumerism."  Adults now, as you know well from the U<font color=red>.</font>S<font color=red>.</font>, are still often embodiments of <font color=red>19</font>60's radicalism; and <font color=red>in England</font> the Laborites are back in power.  Ms. Koening should have had a clue about <font color=red>[that] this</font> from the New York <font color=red>[City whence]</font> she fled.  What turned <font color=red>[NYC] New York</font> into the wasteland it had become by the <font color=red>19</font>80's?  Laissez-faire?  Or, perhaps, the nastiest <font color=red>of the</font> leftist shibboleths (e.g. rent control) that have ever been applied in the United States.  New York was not a Babylon of consumerism; it was Moscow-on-the-Hudson, steadily constructed as such since the end of World War II.  A clue about this in Britain is evident in Koenig's own story:  She could not find a politically correct term for the "lower class" neighborhood near her own -- class warfare does not allow disparaging, or even accurate, characterizations of the oppressed.

<P><font color=red>[When dissimulating socialists (i.e. Democrats) in the United States are still on the offensive, it is long past the time when any of their terms of debate ("materialism," "consumerism," "compassion," etc.) can be accepted.  Virginia Postrel doesn't seem to be among your directors, but you could probably get similar feedback from Sally Pipes.]</font>
