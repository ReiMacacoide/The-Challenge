Is this text box seen / read in a “box”? 
Maybe is a phone or a computer ( box )... 
By the way, I feel my self musical... 
Does mean I am Music? 
Well, information is Musical, and Music only depends on who wish to play music. 
“ Ego is Awesome, if you don’t wish to possess something if not Music!” 
You, I mean, You being me, you reading me in your self, not in myself, so I am trying to talk by me through You, being me not You, vibrating Music!
Does your attention create what you can describe about what your mind did? 
My attention did create that question, in me, thinking about some “one” as a possibility of being something / someone I don’t know. Why is that? Maybe my brain is creating something ! :) 
Well, what ever it is, it is musical, and can be only felt in animals with body ( rational normally have care to spend more Time dancing those pieaces of information ) that are as “musical” as an “emotional” box.
