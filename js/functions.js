  'pnote': 'So here I am Diving Into the Code I should to finish my Quest!',
  'pcode1': 'The main "problem" when starting to learn how to develop any programming language: <b>Functions</b>! <br><br> <q>We dont need to fully understand something to work with, use it for or experience it, since we dont have fully understanding how our body <il>Works</il> aka <i>Process all Information</i> to work as it should, while to understand we need to compare Data / Information</q>.<br><br> I will try to explain functions, while I am still learning about them, so this text will have "two" pages. I <b>challenge</b> my self to be a <q>Dynamic Web-Page</q> in a clickable button with the [Next] option, to clean the actual page content and <i>Inject</i> the new <q>Page</q> content. <br><br> In any way to create any kind of communication, we need to make relations between <b>Objects{}</b> or Data it self, using <b>Functions()</b> to find some "truth" in Data / Objects that exist or Not. <br><br> So where we were? Oh yes.. How to understand and learn about <b>functions</b> in <b>JavaScript</b>. Well, if I ask my self, how do I write this code in a simplistic way?: <br><br> <q> The Brain needs to auto compare what is going to be expressed, while expressing, to find if what is expressed is <b>True</b> or <b>False</b></q> and deeper <b>Right</b> or <b>Wrong</b>. <br><br>This means what most everyone in the world know by experience: <q> We Learn from Our Errors, which means, everyone must do mistakes to learn or at least, to understand.</q> <br><br>Browsers like <a href="https://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/download-chromium" target="_blank">Chromium</a> or <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_blank">Firefox</a> have a tool to <b>Inspect</b> websites code called Browser <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Browser_Console" target="_blank">Console</a> by opening it using <q>F12</q>, therefor we use it in our localhost. But in this case, I can simply open the file using the keyword combination <q>CTRL+O</q> and refresh the page using <q>F5</q> to see how the page looks like and behave (test). <br><br> Learning how to program is like learning how to behave, seeing others behaviors, defending those behaviors with an explanation. Education. I Like to COPY because is impossible to NOT copy anything we wish to learn. <br><br> You have the right to copy or download all the content of my pages, since in fact everything I share is here (including the music) for you, free to Download, and with the content in your hard drive, you have the right to Mix, Change, and delete? LoL ...  since that part is not included in the <a href="https://odicforcesounds.com/#/license" target="_blank">License</a>. <br><br> First July of 2019 and I have a lot of work to do, till the end of this year. I read and re-read and re-read again. The cycling redundant process of studing to understand anything is what we expect as a path to learn any subject in this Long-Short life experience we all live, and lets assume, <b>JavaScript</b> is like any other programming language, a way to <q>Manipulate</q> static data to give us a <q>Sensation</q> of <q>Natural Life Reaction</q> that exist in any <q>Living Body</q> which is a <q> Informational State</q>, that normally reacts in the moment we <q>TEST</q> what we wish to find if what we are searching for, is <b>defined</b>. <br><br> <b>Noob confession</b>: I pass all my life trying to know / find the limits of any <q>Programming Language</q>... and in the middle-time, I discover that I define the limits, which is super-very-obvious to most everyone, who wish to define the reason to use <b> Programming Languages</b>. LoL <br><br> By that principle, if I define the limits where any <q>Programming Language</q> have no limits, I <b>define</b> what I need to learn, which are my limits!! <br><br> Q: So what each need to learn to learn what each desire to learn? <br>  A: Each needs to Learn how To <b>define</b> the limits of <q>Life Interaction</q> with... <br> A: with Any <q>Language</q> he/she connects with, where each, try to find each one <b>truth</b> of what each did <b>Define</b> as their own limits, in other <b>Objects</b> aka with the <b>Class</b> person that is a <b>Class</b> of <q>living organisms</q> . <br><br> So lets talk about the WEB! <br> The Web is DATA aka metadata ( confirmation of data ) and DATA have several <b>types</b> of it self. Numbers, Booleans, Strings, Arrays, Objects, Class\'s and many other fragments of DATA structures (ways of organizing data) aka <b>knowledge</b> that can be used in a functional relationship in reality to find the <b>truth</b> of it self. <br><br> As you may know, <b>Truth</b> can only exist in a relationship of two or more <q>persons</q> or <q>functions</q> that try to find some <b>truth</b> in what they wish to define as truth, which means that truth is only the confirmation of others information. aka <b>metadata</b>. <br><br> So I have no Choice to assume that <b>JavaScript</b> is good to <q>Hide</q> or automate how in this case, the page behaves, but not really to share (expand) DATA! Therefor I need to dedicate some Time to organize a XML book to give more <b>metadata</b> to <a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">Google</a> Index-Bots (records) to expand more my Manifest!! <br><br> The Coolest detail is: <b>Android</b> make a lot of use of <b>XML</b> technology, which will help me to simplify how this website will work. Maybe as a bridge to talk with Web clients [Computers] and Our Own Mobil Application clients that we need to define to build this challenge!!  <br><br> Maybe is not a bad idea to organize one or more <b>XML</b> books to serve all domains of this project. Till now (3) <br><br> Anyway I made a Google search to compare <b>XML</b> vs <b>JSON</b> and I did find <a href="https://www.javatpoint.com/json-vs-xml" target="_blank">this</a> link, where we can read what we should use in our needs! To my Needs and to this Project-Page Needs, we need Both! So I will define some files for many proposes of this project! By the way, <b>Github</b> have awesome shares from awesome group of people who made the Web as it is! <b><a href="https://github.com/w3c/web-roadmaps" target="_blank">W3C</a></b>, which are who define the Web, and they share everything we need to help us in this choice as that link above. I have no experience or enough knowledge of <q>Project Design</q> but lets say, since XML is good for documentation and asked by Google to index page content, XML is useful to that propose, while is useful as well for Mobil Applications. <br><br> Mr.JSON is part of JS World as XML. I need to follow the easy funny part of what is already defined by the <q>Oracle</q>: <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/12.2/adjsn/lot.html" target="_blank">JSON</a> !! <br><br> To continue... :p ',
