# The World In Progress

Sharing some <b>Poetry / Literature</b> just for Fun:

"If Time is Built Within Our Self's, then Time is Our Self's as result of Time it Self"

- "You are the Wood" : [America]() - [White Tiger]()
- "I am the Fire" : [Asia]() - [Fire Dragon]()
- Which means: 1 + 1 = 1 OR 3 ([Tao](https://www.odicforcesounds.com/#/tao))


We are here to try to Fix [Common Errors](/404.md)

> ## Most of <b>World</b> problems are <b>Logic</b> problems

<b>Logic</b> Refers: <b>Ego</b>!

Each one <b>Ego</b> is each one "holy" <b>tool</b> to <b>create</b> anything each one wish to!

### Let us Try to Solve some of them, while We Can...

### So, the best way we can help, is by asking You to keep Reading!

> ## <b>Fantasy</b> [1] + <b>Logic</b> [1] = <b>Application</b> [1]

### A Simple Mental Exercise:

> ## [OM]() [1] [Fantasy](/docs/Tao/Yang/0/Fantasy/Fantasy.md) (**Yang**(0)) : "We Came In Peace - Trance Zone"

1. Full in your Natural Air Box and stop Your breath for some moments.

- What You are thinking about in that moment, will take Your mind to some "place" called "Dream". ( it is only in your mind) So we <b>Sum</b> that "Dream" to the last step, and we call this next step  <b>Spirit</b>, which is about that abstract capacity we all have, where we "produce" <b>Fantasy</b> while comparing our self's to those creations, which means, we are using: <b>Logic</b>:

> ## '+' [Spirit]() [1] [Logic](/docs/Tao/Yin/1/Logic/Logic.md) (**Yin**(1)) : "Our Eternal License"

- By <b>Logic</b>, each person (men or woman) in the world, even having the same skills or (body tools), we assume that all develop  something different from all others. That is our <b>Spirit</b>! 

- This Concept of being Logicly Some "Fantastic-Self-Creation" give us a good suggestion as Slogan:

- <b>Our Spirit - Our Style</b>

- Styles are about <b>Colors</b> and Colors is one of the Brain Creation when listning <b>Music</b> which is made of <b>Sound</b>.

- <b>Sound</b> is an <b>Expression</b> of <b>Movement</b> in <b>Space</b>.

- Share Your Voice Sound, Expressing Your Inner Self Creation.

> ## = [Expression]() [1] [Application](/docs/Tao/Tao.md)

- I don't know about your Sound...
- But if someone else above yourself did listen to...
- Then You can share with them about those effects.
- We call that <b>Science</b>!

>>>>>>>>>>>  #### WHAT!? :) 

Yes, <b>children</b> and "non-rational" <b>animals</b> are doing <b>Science</b> from the day they were born.

So let's Read about Our <b>Challange</b>, which is about a Dream that is only in my head, that aims to become Reality!

## <b>Challenge</b> Global Notes:

- We always need a Path or a Roadmap.
- In this case the [Paths](/docs/Fragments/Path/README.md) are for <b>Players</b> and the Roadmap to <b>Developers</b>.
- To Motivate You to participate in this Challenge, I include All (Players, Developers, Investors, and All next Generations) in my [Eternal_License](https://github.com/odicforcesounds/Eternal-License/blob/master/README.md), therefor You Should accept to start participating <b>NOW</b>, if You wish to <b>NOT</b> be Included!

- Now, that You know more about my Motivations, lets talk about [Your](/docs/Fragmens/UserInterface/README.md) motivations which drop You with a [Privacy](/docs/Fragmens/Privacy/README.md) Problem that <b>Face</b> our Roadmap Dream, when using your [Devices](/docs/Fragmens/Devices/README.md)!
