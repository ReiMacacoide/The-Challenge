# Visions of Thor - My Son

The first album is in fact about Thor, the one who have the first vision of what was really happening. As Thor was who was sending light, he is the first one who see. He saw Buddha falling and he listen Shiva words (Out of Compassion for Me, don’t Destroy my Gifts) which is represented as a Love and Pain letter between Buddha and Shiva with the title “ Burned in the Hands of Wind - Noisy Silence“. Because I am the one who get Shiva information’s about many things related to this story, I had the need to be included not only as gods voice, but as a single human too, telling the world that “ We are the Ones“, and all information sent by Shiva itself in form of signals vibrations, are related to his Snakes. The key to understand Shiva signals was in a Invisible Frequency, that represent a must change, my own change, my own behavior, giving me an constant Internal Spiritual Upgrade, to have a method to detect where was the Evil in this reality. The main mission was to target the World, so all could pay attention to human care key solution, that is inside of the will of Love and Freedom, by loving someone, and Save Water, which is the key to human Life.
