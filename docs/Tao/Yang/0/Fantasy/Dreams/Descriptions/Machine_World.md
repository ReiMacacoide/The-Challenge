# Machine World

This album is in fact a description of reality in the way of describing the human abstract wills and desires, to upgrade knowledge and to use technology for their own progress. In the shadows, there was a Storming Plan to reclaim War, because this reality was draining human’s time and true pleasure, the simplicity of living Free. Humanity was more and more concentrated in cities, and human laws ask control to all of them. They live for business and pleasures mostly at night, where all the interactions were close to any jungle. in any forest. Listening groovy music in a strange way, vibrations could be noisy and they were putting their life’s, between Panic and Luck In form of Art and Expression, they represent pain in many ways and in different forms using different sources, to break their personal noise, so they could clean their soul like a thunder. and finally understand that nothing was wrong with them, because it was only a way to express them self’s.
