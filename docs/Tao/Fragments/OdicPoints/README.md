### The BlockChain Eco System

![](../../../../images/Points.jpg)

##### 1 Approved Action === 1 Point | 1 Point === +1 coin

##### 1 Denied Action === 0 Points | 0 Points === +0 Coins

What is the **Value** of an **Expression** of **Care**?

#### Brands
- While a single user gain one single point for each approved action, companies or Brands gain one point for each employee point.
- Brands or Companies use OdicPoints to be Higher or Lower between all others Ranking Points.

#### User / Player
- By the sense of justice, a citizen who help the community envioriment should be rewarded for that choice. Points become Coins for **Users Only**!

- Each OdicPoint User have in Each Status Path, can be Converted into OdicCoins.
- This OdicCoins Should have Expression in Reality, so a User can use it in a Store.
- Optionaly this platform should offer a Store Place ( only to those ( individuals )) who are at least participating activly in the Challenge!

#### CryptoCoins Respective Challenge:
- CryptoCoins Communities Should care about the Energy that is spend by each single user of this Competition. If one Approved action represents Value, a CryptoCoin Should be given to each User Approved Action.

For those who don't have the will to clean or **help** Nature environment, because they have no motivation.  Now you have many motivations!

Earn **Points**, earn **Game status**, earn **Professional Status**, earn **Social Status**, earn **Life experience**, earn Personal and Community **Business** Gratitude!

### Note: 

How much is the Value of a Choice that doesn't Have Value? Maybe there is no Value, therefor we can exchange what doesn't have any Numeric Value with something that does have. Let us create a simple possible example:

Lets say "you" did made some action that benefit others with sucess. You got one single "Coin / Point" that have only the Value of a choice. Those who have business, agree that a Choice who cares others have no Value. Then it would be possible to exchange one single "Coin / Point" with a reward that have the same Value ( The value of Choice ).

This Take us to the condition, where everyone ( not excluding anyone ), can help each others without "loosing" anything at all because there is not Value related to a choice who cares.

Imagine You have X point in this challenge and you need to eat something but you have no money. All brands registered in this challenge, should accept to exchange one "coin / point" with food that clear your need.
