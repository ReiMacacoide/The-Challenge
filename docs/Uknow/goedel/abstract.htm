<P><blockquote>An attempt is made to explicate and analyze Kurt G&ouml;del's philosophy of mathematics with emphasis on his defense of classical mathematics, and his rejection of intuitionism, and the vicious circle principle.  G&ouml;del's belief in the real existence of mathematical objects is examined.  It is argued that one need not accept G&ouml;del's pronounced realism in order to assent to his methodology of mathematics.</blockquote></center>
