<P><font size=+1>But the real trouble with Mr. Parini's stance [about Jesus] isn't so much its incoherence as its banality.  It's the same with all attempts to make religion palatable to the learned.  Rather than accepting its authority or ditching it altogether, the urge is to weaken its demands and make its doctrines vague or optional.  The result is usually an agreeable but boring philosophy that anyone can adopt and no one would die for.  "The Way of Jesus...," Mr. Parini writes, "involves self-denial, a sense of losing oneself in order to find oneself, moving through the inevitable pain of life with good cheer, accepting gracefully the burdens that fall on our shoulders and the tasks that lie before us.  This is true discipleship."

<P>If that's all that Jesus came here to tell us, it's hard to see what all the fuss was about.</font>

<P><font size=+1>The Rev. J. Gresham Machen, D.D., who died out in North Dakota on New Year’s Day, got, on the whole, a bad press while he lived, and even his obituaries did much less than justice to him....

<P>What caused him to quit the Princeton Theological Seminary and found a seminary of his own was his complete inability, as a theologian, to square the disingenuous evasions of Modernism with the fundamentals of Christian doctrine. He saw clearly that the only effects that could follow diluting and polluting Christianity in the Modernist manner would be its complete abandonment and ruin. Either it was true or it was not true. If, as he believed, it was true, then there could be no compromise with persons who sought to whittle away its essential postulates, however respectable their motives. 

<P>Thus he fell out with the reformers who have been trying, in late years, to convert the Presbyterian Church into a kind of literary and social club, devoted vaguely to good works....

<P>It is my belief, as a friendly neutral in all such high and ghostly matters, that the body of doctrine known as Modernism is completely incompatible, not only with anything rationally describable as Christianity, but also with anything deserving to pass as religion in general. Religion, if it is to retain any genuine significance, can never be reduced to a series of sweet attitudes, possible to anyone not actually in jail for felony. It is, on the contrary, a corpus of powerful and profound convictions, many of them not open to logical analysis....

<P>What the Modernists have done... [is] to get rid of all the logical difficulties of religion, and yet preserve a generally pious cast of mind. It is a vain enterprise. What they have left, once they have achieved their imprudent scavenging, is hardly more than a row of hollow platitudes, as empty [of] psychological force and effect as so many nursery rhymes...  Religion is something else again -- in Henrik Ibsen’s phrase, something far more deep-down-diving and mud-upbringing.  Dr. Machen tried to impress that obvious fact upon his fellow adherents of the Geneva Muhammad [John Calvin?].  He failed-but he was undoubtedly right.</font>

<P><font size=+1>A frequent visitor to The Swamp parties was the Catholic chaplain of the area, Father John Patrick Mulcahy, a native of San Diego and former Maryknoll missionary.  He was a lean, hungry-looking, hook-nosed, red-haired, and, in the eyes of the Swampmen, one of a kind.

<P>The occupants of The Swamp had loose religious affiliations.  Hawkeye claimed he had been brought up to be an all-over Baptist but that he had lost his nerve at the last minute [i.e. for full immersion baptism].  Duke was a foot-washing Baptist, and Trapper John was a former mackerel-snapper [i.e. a Catholic] who had turned in his knee pads.  It was the Duke who hung the name of Dago [i.e. "Italian," although can also be from Spanish "Diego" -- for an obvious Irishman] Red on the Father, and the Father accepted it with good humor.

<P>Prior to being in the Army, Dago Red had spent five years in China and seven years on top of a mountain in Bolivia.  His contacts had been limited.  With Duke and Hawkeye and Trapper John he found stimulation in conversation that included politics, surgery, sin, baseball, literature and religion.  Dago Red combined the dignity of his profession and the wisdom, understanding and compassion of an honest missionary with the ability to tolerate the Swampmen.  He became one of them.

<P>At two o'clock one morning, Hawkeye and Trapper John were fighting what seemed to be a losing battle in the OR with a kid who had been shot through both chest and belly.  Despite control of hemorrhage and administration of blood, the patient, whose peritoneum had been contaminated for ten hours by spillage from his lacerated colon, went deeper and deeper into shock.

<P>"Maybe we'd better get Dago Red," said Hawkeye.

<P>"Call Dago," ordered Trapper John.</font>

<P><a name="text-6">Religion</a> contains a special domain of evaluation:  &nbsp;the <B>holy</B> or the <B>sacred</B>.  English has these two words because the former is from the <a href="germania.htm#proto">Germanic</a> derivation of the language, while the latter is from Latin <I>sacer</I>, which also has the comparable term <I>sanctus</I> (the past participle of the verb <I>sancio</I>).  Thus, the modern German word is <I>heilig</I>, cognate to "holy," while French has <I>sacr&eacute;</I> and <I>saint</I>, with English borrowing "sacred" and "saint" from French.  While the dual roots in English can be explained by the history of the <a href="perifran.htm#english">language</a>, we may note, not only the apparent practical dualism within the Latin terminology, but the existence of two roots in Greek:  &nbsp;<img src="images/greek/holy.gif" align=middle>, <I>h&aacute;gios</I> (this was <img src="images/greek/hagnos.gif" align=middle>, <I>hagn&oacute;s</I>, in Homer [<a href="#note-6">note</a>]), and <img src="images/greek/sacred.gif" align=middle>, <I>hier&oacute;s</I>.  There seems to be some semantic benefit from the duality.

<P><a name="text-0">My impression is that "holy," <I>sanctus</I>, and <img src="images/greek/holy.gif" align=middle> tend to have a more <a href="concrete.htm">concrete</a> application, to persons and things, while "sacred," <I>sacer</I>, and <img src="images/greek/sacred.gif" align=middle> are more <a href="concrete.htm">abstract</a> in their use.  Thus, a particular holy <I>person</I> in Christianity will be a "saint," in English and French, from <I>sanctus</I>, and a <img src="images/greek/holy.gif" align=middle> in Greek.  Liddell and Scott [<I>An Intermediate Greek-English Lexicon</I>, 1889, 1964] do specify <img src="images/greek/holy.gif" align=middle> as "of things, esp. temples" and "of persons" [p.5], while <img src="images/greek/sacred.gif" align=middle> begins with the more expansive "super-human, mighty, divine, wonderful" [p.376], even while <I>sacer</I> is given as the equivalent for both.  If "holy" takes the personal and concrete role of <img src="images/greek/holy.gif" align=middle>, this is magnified by the intimate and punchy sense that often goes with the English words of Germanic origin (as with "womb" for "uterus").  Although the Germanic words are often monosyllabic in comparison to the Latinate ones, "holy" and "sacred" actually have the same number of syllables -- yet the impression I get is that "sacred" is phonetically more complicated -- as it is, with extra consonants [<a href="#note-0">note</a>].

<P><a name="text-000">"Sacred" has a curious addition in comparison to French <I>sacr&eacute;</I>.  What is the "d"?  I suspect that this reflects the fact that <I>sanctus</I> and <I>sacr&eacute;</I> are both past participles, so "sacred" gets the past participle ending, "-ed" [<a href="#note-000">note</a>].

<P>Nevertheless, the boundary between the "holy" and "sacred" remains vague or weak, and German seems to get by without it:  &nbsp;"Saint" in German is <I>Heilige</I>, while "The Holy," as used by Rudolf Otto, is <I>Das Heilige</I>.  Curiously, the distinction that German does not make with <I>heilig</I>, and that English does with "holy/sacred," German makes with its <a href="cognates.htm">knowing</a> words, and English does not.  Thus, German <I>kennen</I> means "know" or "be acquainted with," specifically with persons or places, i.e. with the concrete reference to objects of "holy," while <I>wissen</I> is "know" in a more abstract and general sense, like "sacred."  English only has "know," which makes it awkward for English speakers to learn to use the German knowing words, or those of the Romance languages that make a similar distinction.

<P>"Holy" or "sacred" in <a href="egypt.htm">Egyptian</a> hieroglyphics is <img src="images/hiero/hiero.gif" align=middle>, which also happens to be the name of the principal King of the <a href="notes/oldking.htm#3">III Dynasty</a>.  In <a href="notes/oldking.htm#sumer">Sumerian</a> it is <img src="images/hiero/sacred01.gif" align=middle>, <I>kungal</I> or <I>kugngal</I>.  In Akkadian, the first sign becomes <img src="images/hiero/bab-sacr.gif" align=middle>, which means "pure, clear" and figures, as in Sumerian, in the words for "gold" (<B>&#x1e2b;ur&acirc;&#x1e63;u</B>), "silver" (<B>kaspu</B>), etc.  However, Akkadian also has terms from the same root as "sacred" in Hebrew -- the noun <img src="images/greek/qodesh.gif" align=middle>, and the adjective, <img src="images/greek/qadosh.gif" align=middle> -- and in Arabic -- the noun <img src="images/greek/quds.gif" align=middle>, and the adjective <img src="images/greek/qudsi.gif" align=middle> -- namely <B>quddu&#x0161;u</B>, "purified, consecrated," <B>qad&acirc;&#x0161;u</B>, "to be(come) pure," and, especially, with some transposition in the root, <B>qa&#x0161;du</B>, "pure, holy," and <B>qu&#x0161;&#x0161;udu</B>, "very holy, sanctified."  I have not seen ideographic writings for these; so, for all I know, they were just written phonetically.

<P>The <a href="newspain.htm#maya">Mayan</a> glyph for "sacred" is <img src="images/hiero/sacred02.gif" align=middle>.  And the Chinese character for the concept is <img src="images/hiero/sacred.gif" align=middle> -- as in <img src="images/hiero/sacred.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/person.gif" align=middle> (Japanese <I>sh&ocirc;nin</I>), "holy man," "Sage," or even "<a href="confuci.htm">Confucius</a>."  The binomes <img src="images/hiero/sacred.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/earth3.gif" align=middle>, "holy ground" or "Holy Land," and <img src="images/hiero/sacred.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/spirit.gif" align=middle>, "Holy Spirit," can be used as Christian terminology.  <img src="images/hiero/sacred.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/person.gif" align=middle> is used, not just for Confucius himself, but equally by Taoism in the <a href="taote.htm"><I>Tao Te Ching</I></a>, for Taoist hermit or mendicant sages, and by Buddhism for monks, hermits, mendicants, and the founders of Buddhist schools (such as <B>Nichiren</B>, <img src="images/hiero/nichiren.gif" align=middle>, <B>Daish&ocirc;nin</B>, <img src="images/hiero/great.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/sacred.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/person.gif" align=middle>, the "Great Holy Man," the founder of <a href="six.htm#nichiren">Nichiren Buddhism</a>).

<P>In most of the languages now cited, it is not difficult to distinguish that the sacred has two sorts of opposites and three forms of opposition.  The opposites are:

<ol><li>The <B>polluted</B> or <B>unholy</b>, <img src="images/greek/polluted.gif" align=middle>, <I>molysm&oacute;s</I>, <img src="images/greek/unholy.gif" align=middle>, <I>an&iacute;eros</I> (literally "unholy"), or <img src="images/greek/impure.gif" align=middle>, <I>ak&aacute;thartos</I> (literally "impure") in Greek.  In Chinese this is <img src="images/hiero/polluted.gif" align=middle> or <img src="images/hiero/unclean.gif" align=middle>, or <img src="images/hiero/polluted.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/unclean.gif" align=middle> together; and

<P><li>What may be called the common, <B>mundane</B>, worldly, or secular. In Greek this can be <img src="images/greek/mundane.gif" align=middle>, <I>kosmik&oacute;s</I> (literally "worldly," as with <I>mundus</I>, "world," in Latin), and in Chinese <img src="images/hiero/mundane.gif" align=middle> or <img src="images/hiero/common.gif" align=middle>.  <img src="images/profane.gif" align=right>In Arabic, <img src="images/greek/worldly.gif" align=middle>, <I>dunyaw&icirc;</I>, "worldly" (from <img src="images/greek/world2.gif" align=middle>, <I>duny&acirc;</I>, "world"), has exactly the same connotation.  On the other hand, the "<B>profane</B>" may be either polluted <B>or</B> merely mundane (and clean), which is nicely expressed by the Latin word <I>profanus</I>, which literally is that "before" (<I>pro</I>) or outside the "temple" (<I>fanum</I>).  What is outside the temple, of course, may be impure or merely secular.  The distinction between mundane and profane is not always carefully made (and is actually confused by one of its classic treatments, <a href="vocab.htm">Eliade's</a> <I>The Sacred and the Profane</I>).  Indeed, there is no <I>authoritative</I> differentiation of these terms.  We have also seen how <img src="images/greek/pious.gif" align=middle>, "pious," may fit into this ground.
</ol>

<P><a name="text-1">The relationship between the holy, the polluted, and the common is similar to that between the beautiful (Greek <img src="images/greek/beauty.gif" align=middle>, <I>kal&oacute;s</I>), the ugly (<img src="images/greek/ugly.gif" align=middle>, <I>aischr&oacute;s</I>), and the plain (<img src="images/greek/plain.gif" align=middle>, <I>hapl&oacute;os</I>) in aesthetic value.  There are no <I>degrees</I> of transition between the beautiful and the ugly.  Something cannot really be <I>both</I> beautiful and ugly at the same time -- except in different respects, as in a portrait of an ugly person, e.g. <IMG SRC="images/relig-4.gif" align="left">Socrates, that is nevertheless beautifully done or revealing of the beautiful soul, e.g. Socrates [<a href="#note-1">note</a>].  On the other hand, there <I>are</I> degrees of being beautiful or ugly, but both of them tend to the third pole, the plain.

<P>Similarly, something cannot be both sacred and polluted at the same time, but there are <I>degrees</I> of sacredness and pollution, with each tending to the third pole, the common and secular.

<P>Religious value is more complex than aesthetic value because three forms of opposition mark off each of the three poles of the sacred and its two opposites.  Thus, there is a difference between 1) <B>the sacred and the profane</B>, 2) <B>the clean (<img src="images/greek/pure.gif" align=middle>, <I>kathar&oacute;s</I>) and the unclean</B>, and 3) <B>the numinous (<I>numinosus</I>) and the mundane (<I>mundanus</I>)</B>.

<P>The term "<a href="numinos.htm">numinous</a>," introduced by <a href="otto.htm">Rudolf Otto</a>, <img src="images/profane.gif" align=right>derives from Latin <I>numen</I>, a word that does not seem to have a precise Greek equivalent.  It partakes of elements of <img src="images/greek/sacred.gif" align=middle> and <img src="images/greek/deinos.gif" align=middle>, <I>dein&oacute;s</I>, "fearful, terrible," with "mighty, powerful, wondrous, marvellous, strange," but also "able, clever, skillful" [Liddell & Scott, pp.176-177], which is drifting from the semantic field.  <I>Numen</I> is the particular power, presence, majesty, terror, and will of a deity, with the term deriving from an archaic verb "to nod" (<I>nuo</I>), which may literally mean the nodding of the head of a deity's statue, something that could be done to give an oracular response to questions, especially as a statue is carried in a procession -- as the god <a href="notes/midking.htm#12">Amon</a> was from Karnak to Luxor and back.  This can still happen with Chistian saints today, especially when they are carried in procession.  The Latin word thus may have its origin in a specific context that did not produce a comparable term in Greek.<br clear=left>

<P><IMG SRC="images/relig-3.gif" align="left">

What is holy is therefore sacred, clean, and numinous.  What is polluted or unholy is profane, unclean, and numinous.  And what is common is profane, clean, and mundane.  In many ancient religions, one of the most important oppositions is between the clean and the unclean.  Many of the rules in the Old Testament concern pollution and cleansing; but cleansing, of course, does not make anything <I>sacred</I>, it merely makes it <I>worthy</I> of becoming, approaching, or associating with the sacred.  In almost mathematical terms, nothing can exist on the track expressing degrees of sacredness without leaving the track showing degrees of pollution.  The opposition between the sacred and the profane is often confusing because of the bivalence of the category of the profane.  Webster's dictionary has one definition of the profane that is mundane, "not concerned with religion or religious purposes: SECULAR," one that definitely involves pollution, "serving to debase or defile what is holy," and one that is mixed or the profane proper, "not holy because unconsecrated, impure, or defiled: UNSANCTIFIED."  "Unconsecrated" and "unsanctified" will mean simply the non-sacred, i.e. either unholy or mundane.

<P>The third form of opposition, between the numinous and the mundane, is essentially between matters of religious concern and those that are not.  <img src="images/profane2.gif" align=right>Whether of the holy or of the polluted, religious valuation can be said to possess "numinosity" (<I>numinositas</I>).  This can be covered for a start by at least two characters in Chinese.  The character <img src="images/hiero/spirit.gif" align=middle> is "spirit, spiritual, divine, supernatural, efficacious."  This is the religious power that objects or rituals have to produce their effects, which not only is one sense of the numinous but is quite close to the meaning of <I>mana</I>, religious power, in Polynesian languages, as considered below.  Then there is <img src="images/hiero/uncanny.gif" align=middle>, which is the quality of the supernatural as <I>uncanniness</I>, "strange, uncanny, weird, wonderful."  This is the mystery and power of the sacred (or, <I>mutatis mutandis</I>, the polluted) set apart from common, ordinary, worldly, secular, and mundane things.  The uncanny is the positive and distinct feeling that we get, often associated with hair standing on end, in the presence of supernatural and unnatural presences.  We sometimes wonder if dogs, barking at nothing, or cats, with their hair standing on end, are having the same sensation.

<P>Holiness and pollution can both be dangerous, but the difference is that pollution is not sought for its own sake but is often acquired despite that (through spilling blood, having sex, menstruating, eating the wrong things, etc.).  Ritual actions are required to remove pollution.  <IMG SRC="images/borrome4.gif" align="left">Ritual actions are also required before dealing with holy things, in part to remove pollution but also to prepare for the dangers posed by holiness itself.  There is nothing dangerous about the merely mundane.  It is just a kind of emptiness in comparison.

<P>The holy and the polluted pose a threat to each other.  The concepts "defile," "debase," and "desecrate" reveal that even what is holy, as well as what is clean and mundane, can be damaged by the unholy.  If the divine presence in a temple is of value to a community because of the protection that the god provides, the desecration of the temple may not harm the god, but it may certainly harm the community, as the means of pleasing and accessing the god are compromised.  On the other hand, something may be so holy that it <I>cannot</I> be desecrated.  Thus Alfred Kohlatch [<I>This is the Torah</I>, Jonathan David Publishers, 1988] quotes Rabbi Judah ben Bathyra as saying, "Words of the Torah are not susceptible to uncleanness."  Kohlatch adds, "No individual, not even one who is ritually impure, can defile a Torah by touching or handling it," and "the Talmud states clearly that a Torah scroll cannot be made ritually unclean regardless of who handles it."  On the other hand, the holy is also definitely a threat to the polluted, as is well illustrated in the Biblical destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah.

<P>An intense concern with pollution, and especially death pollution, is conspicuous in two religions of historical note, Shintoism (<img src="images/hiero/kami.gif" align=middle><img src="images/dao2.gif" align=middle>, <I>Shint&ocirc;</I>, the "way of the gods") in Japan and the religion of the Navajo Nation in the American Southwest.  Before the <a href="sangoku.htm#nara">Nara Period</a> in Japanese history, a permanent capital for the country did not exist because the death of an Emperor would render his dwelling uninhabitable from death pollution.  Even later, the Court was often troubled by the absence of officials who were isolated for long periods of purification because of contact with death.  <img src="images/hiero/polluted.gif" align=right border=3>Shintoism, therefore, was more than happy to leave funeral rites and cemeteries to the care of Buddhism, although this then made Buddhist monks so closely associated with death that it was prohibited to even <I>speak</I> of them, or anything about them, at the great shrine of the Sun goddess Amaterasu at Ise, without using the special code words that were developed for that purpose.  As we might imagine, it of was often a matter of debate and recourse to official judgment whether or not pollution had been incurred in specific cases.  We discover, for intance, that it may be possible to avoid pollution by standing, rather than sitting, at a deathbed.

<P><a name="hillerman"><img src="images/navajo.gif" align=right>Similarly, a friend of mine in New Mexico recently told me the story of a young Anglo woman who died while teaching at a Navajo school.  Her parents knew how much she loved the school and announced that they would scatter her ashes there.  The principal of the school told them that, well, they could do that, but then <I>no one would ever attend the school again</I>.  There is a great deal of this sort of thing mentioned in the novels of Tony Hillerman.  As with the story of the school, in <I>The Fallen Man</I> [1996], we have the following passage involving one of Hillerman's characters, Navajo Tribal Policeman Jim Chee, who contemplates the proposal to scatter the ashes of a young man, who had loved the land, over Hesperus Peak in Colorado:

<P><blockquote>"We call it Dibe Nitsaa," Chee said.  He thought of a dead man's ashes drifting down on serene slopes that the spirit called First Man had built to protect the Navajos from evil.  First Man had decorated the mountain with jet-black jewelry to fend off all bad things.  But what could protect it from the invincible ignorance of the white culture?  These were good, kind people, he thought, who wouldn't knowingly use corpse powder, the Navajo symbol for the ultimate evil, to desecrate a holy place...

<P>"Its our Sacred Mountain of the North," Chee said. [HarperTorch, 2002, p.50]</blockquote>

<P><B>Dib&eacute; Ntsaa</B> is one of four peaks that define the corners of the <B>Din&eacute;tah</B>, the Navajo homeland (with Blanca Peak, <B>Sisnaajinii</B>, in the Sangre de Cristo Range of <a href="ross/calif.htm#peaks">Colorado</a>, Mount Taylor, <B>Tsoodzil</B>, above Grants, New Mexico, and the San Francisco Peaks, <B>Dook'o'oosl&iacute;&iacute;d</B>, above Flagstaff, Arizona, standing in the East, South, and West, respectively).  As in Shinto, the death of a person within a dwelling will require it to be abandoned, as the dangerous <a href="soul.htm#egypt">ghost</a>, the <I>chindi</I>, would be trapped inside.  In the history of human burial customs, we have the interesting variation in the traditional Navajo practice, not just of burying the dead, but of <I>hiding the body</I> in a perhaps unlikely or inaccessible location.  This was to prevent it from being retrieved by witches, who would make it into "corpse powder" to use in sickening or killing people.  Hence the alarm, real and fictional, at the scattering of human ashes.

<P>A system of religious ritual prohibitions, like the Polynesian <I>tapu</I> system ("taboo," the <a href="hawaii.htm">Hawaiian</a> <I>kapu</I> -- in Chinese we have <img src="images/hiero/taboo.gif" align=middle>, "fear, dread, taboo," etc., or <img src="images/hiero/taboo.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/avoid.gif" align=middle>, "taboo" or "avoid as taboo"), serves to keep the various categories separate.  The Hawaiian historian R.S. Kuykendall says:

<P><blockquote>In its fundamental meaning tapu [kapu] as a word was used primarily as an adjective and as such signified that which was psychically dangerous, hence restricted, forbidden, set apart, to be avoided, because:  (a) divine, therefore requiring isolation for its own sake from both the common and the corrupt; (b) corrupt, hence dangerous to the common and the divine, therefore requiring isolation from both for their sakes. [quoted by Ralph S. Kuykendall, <I>The Hawaiian Kingdom</I>, vol. I, U. of Hawaii Press, 1968, p. 8]</blockquote>

<P>This illustrates nicely the <I>two</I> opposites of the sacred and the dual nature of the barriers that must protect both the holy from everything else and everything else from what is polluted.  Hawaiian <I>kapus</I> had a lot to do with eating, especially that men and women could not eat together.  The <I>kapu</I> system was overthrown in 1819 when the new King Kamehameha II Liholiho simply sat down and ate with the court women.  This was before Christian missionaries had even arrived in Hawaii.

<P>The similarity of the sacred and the polluted was already noted by James George Frazer:

<P><blockquote>In general, we may say that the prohibition to use the vessels, garments, and so forth of certain persons, and the effects supposed to follow an infraction of the rule, are exactly the same whether the persons to whom the things belong are sacred or what we might call unclean and polluted. [<I>The Golden Bough, A Study in Magic and Religion</I>, A New Abridgement by Robert Fraser, Oxford University Press, 1994, p.175]</blockquote>

<P>Frazer, however, thinks that this makes the sacred and the polluted somehow ultimately the same thing:

<P><blockquote>The uncleanness, as it is called, of girls at puberty and the sanctity of holy men do not, to the primitive mind, differ materially from each other.  They are only different manifestations of the same mysterious energy which, like energy in general, is in itself neither good nor bad, but becomes beneficent or maleficent according to its application. [p.703]</blockquote>

<P>Frazer has confused the boundaries, which are the prohibitions (the <I>kapus</I>) connected with the sacred and the polluted, with the <I>content</I> of that which is restricted.  A separate vocabulary reflects the <I>polarity</I> of the different contents.

<P><a name="hawaii">In Hawaiian, <I>la'a</I> is "Sacred, holy, devoted, consecrated, set apart for sacred purposes, dedicated," and the causative <I>ho'ola'a</I> is "To consecrate, dedicate, hallow."  <I>Mana</I> is numinosity in general, "Supernatural or divine power" (<img src="images/hiero/spirit.gif" align=middle>) and even "a powerful nation, authority," while <I>ho'omana</I> ("<I>make</I> divinely powerful") is used to mean "religion" or "place in authority, empower, authorize."  Another term, <I>haumia</I>, is used to mean "unclean, defiled" -- with its opposite <I>ma'ema'e</I>, "clean, pure, caste" [Mary Kawena Pukui & Samuel H. Elbert, <I>Hawaiian Dictionary</I>, University of Hawaii Press, 1973, pp. 173, 217, 57, 201].  The real difference between <I>la'a</I> and <I>haumia</I>, of course, is that the properly protected force of the sacred is expected to produce good effects (good weather, harvest, fertility, etc.), while the polluted will blight these effects if not properly isolated.  In short, prohibitions of the sacred are intended to protect <I>it</I>, as well as protect others from the ill effects of improper contact with its power, while prohibitions of the polluted are intended entirely to protect everything else from its danger.  Frazer was carried away with the analogy to energy and so neglected the polarity of value evident in the rest of "primitive" vocabulary -- positive and negative charges, not energy in general, <a href="hawaii.htm#syllabary"><img src="images/relig-6.gif" align=right border=0></a>are the suggestive analogy from science.  Since Frazer doesn't <I>mention</I> the contrast between <I>la'a</I> and <I>haumia</I>, we may accuse him of neglecting a key piece of falsifying data.  At right we see the Hawaiian terminology, also written in the "<a href="hawaii.htm#syllabary">fantasy syllabary</a>" for the language.

<P>There is also what is in contrast to the whole of complex of <I>la'a</I>, <I>mana</I>, and <I>haumia</I>.  This is the term <I>noa</I>, which in Hawaiian means "Freed of taboo, released from restrictions" or even "Commoner," with <I>ho'onoa</I> meaning "To cause to cease, of a taboo; to free from taboo" [Pukui & Elbert, <I>op. cit.</I>, p. 247].  The reduplication, <I>noanoa</I> also means "Commoner," while <I>ho'onoanoa</I> is the equivalent of <I>ho'onoa</I> [<I>ibid.</I>].  The term <I>noa</I> therefore puts us in the mundane and worldly domain, outside both the sacred and the polluted.

<P>The word, usually unchanged, is quite common throughout Polynesia, and we find a particularly detailed defintion in <I>A Dictionary of the Maori Language of Rarotonga</I> [Stephen Savage, Department of the Island Territories, Wellington, 1962, Institute of Pacific Studies, Ministry of Education, Government of the Cook Islands, 1980]:  &nbsp;"<B>noa</B> n. denotes the state or condition of being free from <B>tapu</B>, sacred, etc., of being common, vulgar, or profane: adj. common, profane, vulgar, pertaining to or being used by the common people; mean or low, rude; of no consequence, insignificant, etc." [p.182].  The equivalent of <I>ho'onoa</I> is <I>aka-noa</I>, "v[erb]. to make common, vulgar, or profane; to make or to be unsanctified"; and we get several other interesting derivatives, <I>ngai-noa</I>, "n[oun]. a place or locality from which restriction has been removed; a place used in common, a common place; an unsanctified place," <I>tangata-noa</I>, "n. a common or vulgar or profane person," <I>ta-noa</I>, "to make or render common, profane or vulgar, to cause to become common, etc., to desecrate," and <I>ta-noanoa</I>, "v. to make collectively or wholly common, vulgar or profane; to desecrate wholly or collectively" [<I>ibid.</I>].  There is also the reduplication, <I>noanoa</I>, which means "to be entirely without restraint or restriction; to become absolutely vulgar or common" [<I>ibid.</I>].  We get a brief entry for Tahitian in <I>A Tahitian and English Dictionary</I> [The London Missionary Society's Press, 1851, Editions Haere Po no Tahiti, 1991], where <I>noa</I> means "common, in opposition to <I>raa</I> [Hawaiian <I>la'a</I>], sacred" [p.155].  In all of these there is an interesting drift of meaning from merely "free of taboo" to "common," "vulgar," or "profane" in the negative and disparaging senses found for those words in English.  The <I>tangatanoa</I> may not be polluted but he is also not of the (relatively) sacred nobility, the <I>ali'i</I> (Hawaiian) or <I>ariki</I> (M&acirc;ori), and is probably "free of restraint" in prudential as well as moral or religious senses.

<P>In Arabic there is a system of terms similar to <I>tapu</I> from the root <I>&#x1e25;aruma</I>, <img src="images/greek/haruma.gif" align=middle>, which by itself is a verb that means "to be forbidden, prohibited, interdicted, unlawful, unpermitted."  What can be forbidden could be either sacred or polluted.  On the sacred side we get <I>&#x1e25;aram</I>, <img src="images/greek/haram.gif" align=middle>, meaning "forbidden, prohibited, holy, sacred, sacrosanct" [from Hans Wehr, <I>A Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic</I>, Cornell University Press, 1966, pp.173-174 for what follows].  It can be also used to mean "wife"; and in the dual, '<I>al-&#x1e24;aram&acirc;n</I>, <img src="images/greek/alharama.gif" align=middle>, "the two Holies," it means the sacred cities of Mecca and Medina.  Similarly there is <I>&#x1e25;urmah</I>, <img src="images/greek/hurma.gif" align=middle>, "holiness, sacredness, sanctity; reverence, veneration, esteem, respect; that which is holy, sacred, inviolable; or a woman, lady, or wife."  <I>&#x1e24;ar&icirc;m</I>, <img src="images/greek/harim.gif" align=middle>, means "a sacred, inviolable place; sanctum, sacred precinct; harem; female members of the family, women; wife."  '<I>I&#x1e25;r&acirc;m</I>, <img src="images/greek/ihram.gif" align=middle>, means "state of ritual consecration of the Mecca pilgrim."  '<I>I&#x1e25;tir&acirc;m</I>, <img src="images/greek/ihtiram.gif" align=middle>, means "deference, respect, regard, etc."  <I>Mu&#x1e25;arram</I>, <img src="images/greek/muharram.gif" align=middle>, is "forbidden, interdicted," and the name of the first month of the Isl&acirc;mic calendar.  <I>Mu&#x1e25;rim</I>, <img src="images/greek/muhrim.gif" align=middle>, is the "Mecca pilgrim who has entered the state of ritual consecration."  And <I>mu&#x1e25;taram</I>, <img src="images/greek/muhtaram.gif" align=middle>, is "honored, revered, venerated, esteemed, respected."

<P>On the negative side, fencing off the polluted, we find <I>&#x1e25;ar&acirc;m</I>, <img src="images/greek/haraam.gif" align=middle>, "forbidden, interdicted, prohibited, unlawful; offense, sin," and '<I>ibn &#x1e25;ar&acirc;m</I>, <img src="images/greek/ibnharam.gif" align=middle>, <I>&#x1e25;ar&acirc;m&icirc;</I>, <img src="images/greek/harami.gif" align=middle>, "son of the forbidden," "illegitimate son, bastard" (this ends up as <I>har&acirc;mz&acirc;d&acirc;</I>,  with the Persian <a href="greek.htm#note-22">patronymic</a> ending, in Hindi, <img src="images/greek/haramzad.gif" align=middle>).  An adjective form of <I>&#x1e25;ar&acirc;m</I> means "thief, robber, bandit."  But <I>&#x1e25;ar&acirc;m</I> can also mean "sacred, sacrosanct," and the <I>Bayt 'al&#x1e24;ar&acirc;m</I>, <img src="images/greek/baytalha.gif" align=middle>, "House of the Forbidden," is the sacred <I>Ka'abah</I>, the House of God in Mecca.  <I>&#x1e24;ur&ucirc;m</I>, <img src="images/greek/hurum.gif" align=middle>, means "excommunication."  <I>Ta&#x1e25;r&icirc;m</I>, <img src="images/greek/tahrim.gif" align=middle>, means "forbiddance, interdiction, prohibition, ban."  When derivatives of the same root, or sometimes the very same derived terms, can mean "bandit, sin, bastard," etc. and also some of the most sacred things in Isl&acirc;m, we certainly have the same kind of bivalent ambiguity as with <I>tapu</I>/<I>kapu</I> in Polynesia and Hawaii.  This ambiguity, however, is speedily clarified when we move to the rest of the vocabulary.  <I>Quds</I>, <img src="images/greek/quds.gif" align=middle>, "holiness, sacredness, sanctity" (or Jerusalem), only applies to the <I>sacred</I> side of the bivalence.

<P>In Egyptian, the word for "sacred," <img src="images/hiero/hiero.gif" align=middle>, used as the name of the greatest King of the <a href="notes/oldking.htm#3">III Dynasty</a>, is also something we find in <img src="images/hiero/necropol.gif" align=middle>, the "Sacred Land," i.e. the Necropolis, where the dead have their "Houses of Eternity."  This is about as sacred as it gets in Ancient Egypt -- see "<a href="tombs.htm">Egyptian Royal Tombs of the New Kingdom</a>" -- though Egyptian tombs have become a favorite locus for horror in modern fiction.

<P><a name="tribunes">The interesting use of boundaries for the sacred involves the Roman officials called "tribunes" (<I>tribuni</I>).  The "tribunes of the plebs" (<I>tribuni plebis</I>) were created to protect the class of Plebs from actions by the Senatorial class, the Patricians (<I>patricii</I>).  They effected this protection because they were "sacrosanct," <I>sacrosanctus</I>, i.e. "consecrated, holy, sacred, inviolable."  As Fustel de Coulanges puts it:

<P><blockquote>...the effect was to render these first tribunes <I>sacrosancti</I>.  Now, these words signified that the body of the tribune should be reckoned thenceforth among the objects which religion forbade to be touched, and whose simple touch made a man unclean.  [Numa Denis Fustel de Coulanges, <I>The Ancient City, A Study of the Religion, Laws, and Institutions of Greece and Rome</I>, translated by Willard Small, 1874, Doubleday & Company, 1955, Dover Publications, 2006, p.293; <I>La cit&eacute; antique</I>, 1865]</blockquote>

<P>As with Fraser above, de Coulanges expresses some uncertainty about what lies beyond numinous barrier:

<P><blockquote>We do not sufficiently understand the ideas of the ancients to say whether this <I>sacrosanct</I> character rendered the person of the tribune honorable in the eyes of the patricians, <img src="images/relig-3.gif" align=right>or marked him, on the contrary, as an object of malediction and horror.  <font color=red>The second conjecture is more in accordance with probability</font>.  What is certain is, that in every way the tribune was inviolable; the hand of a patrician could not touch him without grave impiety.

<P>A law conferred and guaranteed this inviolablility; it declared that "no person should use violence towards a tribune, or strike him, or kill him."  It added that "<font color=red>whoever committed one of these acts against a tribune should be impure</font>, that his property should be confiscated to the profit of the temple of Ceres, and that one might kill him with impunity."  The law concluded in these words, whose vagueness powerfully aided the future progress of the tribuneship:  "No magistrate, or private person, shall have the right to do anything against a tribune." [p.294, color added]</blockquote>

<P>The "probability" that the tribune is "an object of maldediction and horror," however, is clearly inconsistent with the obvious meaning of <I>sacrosanctus</I>, which means benefiting from a rite than renders something "consecrated, holy, sacred, inviolable."  This does give us occasion to reflect, on the other hand, that the consequences of violating the boundary against the sacred and the boundary against the polluted may be similar.  Trespassing into what is unclean exposes one to the contagion of pollution.  This may not actually be a crime against religion, but it does mean that one must undergo some kind of purification.  Thus, contact with blood, menstrual blood, semen, or death may be morally or religious innocent in itself, but purification will be necessary.  On the other hand, improperly trespassing the boundaries of the sacred will at once be morally or religiously wrongful <I>and</I> will render one impure.  The impurity is not from a contagion, but one's own consequent pollution may become <I>contagious</I> unless purified and expiated.

<P>This clearly fits the case of the Roman Tribunes.  They cannot even be <I>touched</I> without the offender suffering, not just pollution, but a <I>guilt</I> that warrants the confiscation of his property and exposes him to violence against his very life.  This is not unusual among sacred beings, even among mortals.  Thus, we see that the <a href="notes/oldking.htm">King of Egypt</a>, the <a href="egypt.htm"><img src="images/hiero/goodgod.gif" align=middle border=0></a>, the "Good God," is too sacred even to be touched without harm.  Similarly, the Emperor of <a href="sangoku.htm#japan">Japan</a> was not supposed to be looked at directly, even as a certain level of sacred nobility in <a href="hawaii.htm">Hawai'i</a> were not supposed to be looked at, at all, by commoners, on pain of death.  Even as these prohibitions attend their sacred status, it is not surprising that similar prohibitions apply where the problem is pollution rather than holiness, as we see in the Untouchable and Unseeable <a href="caste.htm">Castes</a> of traditional India.

<P>This means that it is possible to indeed "understand the ideas of the ancients" to the extent of understanding that the <I>sacrosancti tribuni</I> are protected by a numinous barrier, not because they are unholy or objects of "malediction and horror," but because they have been rendered sacred, as we can tell from their traditional characterization.  This was <I>intended</I> to render them immune from political or legal action.  This enabled them to protect plebeians:

<P><blockquote>If a plebeian was maltreated by a consul who condemned him to imprisonment, or by a creditor who laid hands on him, the tribute appeared, placed himself between them (<I>intercessio</I>), and stayed the patrician hand.  Who would have dared "to do anything against a tribune"...?  [p.294]</blockquote>

<P>This was a great power in Roman politics, as it was intended to be.  And even if a patrician saw this with "malediction and horror," because his political designs or legal claims could be frustrated, to the plebeian it would have been a veritable <I>deus ex machina</I> of divine intervention.

<P>Religion has its numinous character whether the principle objects of religion be immanent or transcendent, e.g. tangible fetishes, idols, places, persons, etc., even states of consciousness, or a supernatural God, heaven, etc.  Religion possesses no special category of <I>moral</I> obligation (i.e. the rites and objects mean nothing to anyone outside the religion) but instead subsumes all the others, usually collapsing them moralistically into the ritual requirements of the religion.  The "holy" is thus often equated with moral goodness or, when that sense isn't so strong, with the beautiful or the sublime.  Numinous value, however, is <a href="poly-1.htm"><I>polynomicly independent</I></a> of other forms of evaluation:  &nbsp;religious practices may be repugnant, the gods (or God) may do bad things, or sacred objects may be ugly or repulsive.  The cleansing of pollution and the preparations for sacred rituals may require moral rectitude or beautiful costumes, or they may require appalling mortifications, self-mutilations, blood sacrifices, etc.  Ritual practices simply may not make any sense.

<P><a name="problem">This polynomic independence occurs to us as the <I><B>problem of evil</B></I>.  If God is omniscient, omnipotent, and benevolent, then why does evil exist?  He would know it exists; he would be able to get rid of it; and he would want to get rid of it.  The problem of evil, however, is more general than a theological difficulty over a transcendent personal God.  Even without God, as in Buddhism, there is still birth, disease, old age, and death.  These were regarded by the Buddha as a problem.  They still are, and we must still ask ourselves why the world often seems to be a "meaningless nightmare of suffering."  If religion offers consolation that the world makes ultimate sense and has a meaning or a purpose, despite all evidence to the contrary, it is holy things that present the tangible (or perhaps intangible) quality of that consolation.

<P>The confusing thing about the world does lie in the <I>mixed signals</I> given us:  because all the polynomic domains of value can vary independently, the holy does not necessarily match up in the natural occurrence of things with the right, the good, or the beautiful.  We want to know why the good suffer, when they do not deserve to; and why the evil prosper, when they do not deserve to.  All the polarities of value -- pleasure and pain, love and hate, right and wrong, good and bad, beauty and ugliness, holiness and pollution -- are like separate rollers on a slot machine.  Every pull of the arm gives us a different combination.  Religious faith is just that we would like to believe that there is some deep connection between the pleasurable, the right, the good, the beautiful, and the holy and that, beyond our reckoning, all the positive aspects of value in some sense <I>do</I> collapse together into one comprehensive form of value.  We can live our lives trying to put all the positive aspects together, trying to get the jackpot on that slot machine, but we know that for ourselves and for the world we can have only limited success.  Religion therefore reassures us that deep in the nature of things, whether here or in the hereafter, all the positive aspects <I>are</I> together.  For religion the holy is precisely <I>how</I> the positive aspects of value <I>are</I> connected.

<P>An important bit of evidence about the polynomic independence of religious from the other forms of value, and about the role of numinosity in answering the problem of evil, occurs in the conflict of "<a href="faith.htm">faith versus works</a>" in several religions.  By the time of Augustine, it is firmly established in Christianity that salvation is due to divine grace, not our own efforts, and that our efforts to be morally good are doomed anyway -- "There is none righteous, no, not one... there is none that doeth good, no, not one" [Romans 3:10,12].  <img src="images/maps/purgator.gif" align=right border=0>As hopeless sinners, we can only be redeemed from our sin by the sacrifice of Christ in the Crucifixion, and our actual salvation, therefore, is independent of our ability to be good.  Mediaeval Catholicism tried to balance the requirements of morality with the requirements of salvation by holding that salvation can be achieved even through repentance <I>in articulo mortis</I>, at the moment of death, but that the "stain" of sin must be worked off in <a href="popes.htm#purgatory">Purgatory</a>.  The repentant sinner thus did not receive a free ride to heaven.  This compromise was actually rejected by Martin Luther, who took Christ's expiation of sin so seriously that <I>sincere</I> repentance truly did wash one free of sin.  Such "salvation by faith alone" even seems to turn up in the third part of the <a href="starwars.htm"><I>Star Wars</I></a> trilogy, <I>The Return of the Jedi</I>, when the vicious tyrant, sorcerer, and mass murderer Darth Vader is redeemed and transfigured at death into the moral equal of the heroes Obi-wan Kenobi and Yoda.

<P>Protestantism is a more consistent and coherent application of Christian doctrine than Catholicism.  Thus, while the Catholic Church distinguishes between "eternal punishment," which is forgiven, and "temporal [i.e. temporary] punishment," which must be expiated by penance [<I>Catechism of the Catholic Church</I>, Doubleday, 1995, pp. 407, 411; translation of the <I>Catechism of the Catholic Church</I>, United States Catholic Conference, Inc., Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1994], Protestants rightly object that this is not a distinction evident in the principle that sin is forgiven by Jesus.  Protestants consequently reject both Purgatory and the mechanism of Confession, Absolution, and Penance in religious life.<br clear=right>

<a name="bede"><H3><I>The Stain of Sin</I></H3>

<P>The Catholic concern, however, reflects an older dimension of religious life.  Although this is certainly not part of Catholic doctrine, Purgatory and penance both make perfect sense in terms of <I>pollution</I>, of which we might be reminded to see Catholic writers, such as the <a href="romania.htm#text-1">Venerable Bede</a>, referring to the "stain of sin" (<I>sordes peccati</I> or <I>sordes vitii</I>, "stain of vice") as what must be <a href="moral-1.htm#expiate">expiated</a>.

<P>[Bede, <I>Homily for Advent</I>, quoted in <I>Heaven's Purge, Purgatory in Late Antiquity</I>, by Isabel Moreira, Oxford, 2010, p.17 & Latin p.262 -- color and punctuation added, translation modified -- note the anomalous sense that salvation is merited by works, or preordained, rather than by faith]</blockquote>

<P>Although I did not find it in the <I>Catechism of the Catholic Church</I>, the doctrine of the "stain of sin" passed into standard Catholic theology, and we see it used by <a href="hist-1.htm#high">St. Thomas</a>, as quoted by Dorothy L. Sayers in her Introduction to Dante's <I>Purgatory</I> [Penguin, 1955, 1965]:

<P><blockquote>Two things may be considered in sin; the guilty act and the consequent stain.  Now it is evident that in all actual sins, when the act of sin has ceased the guilt remains; for the act of sin makes man deserving of punishment, in so far as he transgresses the order of divine justice, to which he cannot return except he pay some sort of penal compensation which restores him to the equality of justice.  Hence, according to the order of divine justice, he who has been too indulgent to his will, by transgressing God's commandment, suffers, either willingly or unwillingly, something contrary to what he would wish.  This restoration of the equality of justice by penal compensation is also to be observed in injuries done to one's fellow-men.  Consequently, it is evident that when the sinful or injurious act has ceased, there still remains the debt of punishment.

<P>But if we speak of the removal of sin as to the stain, it is evident that the stain of sin cannot be removed from the soul without the soul being united to God, since it was through being separated from Him that it suffered the loss of its splendour, in which the stain consists.... Now man is united to God by his will.  Therefore the stain of sin cannot be removed from man unless his will accepts the order of divine justice; that is to say, unless either of his own accord he take upon himself the punishment of his past sin, or bear patiently the punishment which God inflicts upon him; and in both ways punishment has the character of satisfaction.  Now when punishment is satisfactory, it loses somewhat of the nature of punishment, for the nature of punishment is to be against the will: and although satisfactory punishment, absolutely speaking, is against the will, nevertheless, in this particular case and for this particular purpose it is voluntary....  We must therefore say that, when the stain of sin has been removed, there may remain a debt of punishment, not indeed of punishment absolutely, but of satisfactory punishment. [Sayers, pp.58-59, citing <I>Summa Theologica</I>,I.II, q.87, ad 7.]</blockquote>

<P>The curious thing about this passage is that St. Thomas seems to implicitly deny that Salvation in Christ <I>remits</I> the punishment that is merited by sin.  The "debt of punishment" is discharged for all on the Cross.  If this passage is relevant to the doctrine of Purgatory, then we might understand from St. Thomas that Purgatory is a place of punishment and that even "when the stain of sin has been removed," we are still liable for the "debt of punishment," which will be discharged in Purgatory.  Even Bede might still be interpreted that way.  Thus, this passage appears to recognize no difference between punishment and expiation, which, if our sins are forgiven in Christ, will be the only basis for the existence of Purgatory.  Indeed, it is on these terms that Protestants, and now many Catholics, reject Purgatory altogether, whereby the forgiveness and remission of sin, by exempting us from real punishment in Hell, opens the door directly to Heaven.

<P>The doctrine in St. Thomas (or Bede) thus does not look fully formed in the relevant moral and religious terms.  Sayers does not notice or acknowledge this but, in her own discussion, improves it somewhat.  Thus, she says that a sin or a crime results in a <I>culpa</I>, which is "offense, fault, blame, guilt," etc.  The <I>culpa</I> merits punishment, which is delivered by secular justice but is forgiven, in Christ, by divine justice.  She then says:

<P><blockquote>What is left to be done in Purgatory is the purging of the <I>reatus</I>, so far as there may not have been time or opportunity to do this on earth, and, especially, the cleansing of the soul from the <I>stain of sin</I>.  By this is meant the damage done to the soul by the habit of sinfulness... [p.58]</blockquote>

<P>The "stain of sin" is thus associated with, in contrast to the <I>culpa</I>, the <I>reatus</I>.  But Sayers fails to define this interesting word.  Yet <I>reatus</I> means no more than "the state or condition of being an accused person," "an accusation, charge" [<I>Oxford Latin Dictionary</I>, Volume II, P.G.W. Glare, 1982, 2012, p.1738].  As a legal and external term, this looks like a poor choice to describe something that is "the damage done to the soul."  Perhaps Sayers has searched for a term that is actually not provided by St. Thomas.  She admits, "The above is a summary of the Doctrine of Purgatory as generally held by Catholics.  Not every item in it is <I>de fide</I>" [p.60].  Perhaps the <I>reatus</I> is one of those items.

<P>However, something of the sort is needed, and Sayers has the correct instinct.  If the <I>culpa</I>, punishment, and Hell are remitted by Salvation, then what remains as "damage done to the soul," the "stain of sin," is a <I>pollution</I> that is expiated in Purgatory.  Morally, why there is such pollution is because, as I have examined <a href="moral-1.htm#expiate">elsewhere</a>, the <I>malevolence</I> that damages the soul is not, as such, removed by punishment.  It would be better for Sayers to supply the source of the "stain," not in the "habit of sinfulness," but in the inner malevolence of the act, which is not itself remedied by punishment, but is desired in repentance.  The unrepentant criminal, who has served his time, but who then understands the evil of his actions and sincerely repents them, will also understand that the harm done to his own <I>will</I>, which was not touched by external punishment, requires action in its own right.  And that action is expiation through penance, which the criminal will seek for the solace it will provide.  When St. Thomas puzzles over the voluntary or involuntary nature of punishment, he has missed the ground of a division.  Punishment is involuntary, but penance is voluntary.  It cannot be otherwise:  Expiation is only an issue for the penitent.  In these terms, Sayers' contrast between <I>culpa</I> and <I>reatus</I> matches the legal contrast between the <I>actus reus</I>, which is external, and the <a href="moral-2.htm#strict"><I>mens rea</I></a>, which is internal.  Indeed, <I>reatus</I>, <I>reus</I>, and <I>rea</I> are all from the same word, <I>res</I>, "thing, affair" (Greek <img src="images/greek/pragma.gif" align=middle>, Chinese <img src="images/hiero/pragma.gif" align=middle>), with the addition of a judicial sense (that the Greek and Chinese words don't have) of guilt, accusation, or legal liability.

<P><a name="text-2">Thus, not just in Catholicism or Christianity, but in generalized terms of religious morality, Heracles was required to perform his Labors in penance, after killing his wife and children, even though, having been driving mad by Hera, he was not morally responsible for his actions.  The pollution (<img src="images/greek/miasma-1.gif" align=middle>) was the same, although with the Greeks the pollution was from the mere acts, not from any inner will or intention.  The sinner, therefore, may be exempted from the punishment of strict moral retribution, but the pollution must still be removed.  Since this is a strictly numinous quality, its expiation will be by religious, i.e. ritual (Chinese <img src="images/li3.gif" align=middle>), means.  Prayer, fasting, and other ritual acts will do it, or, in turn, the Intercession of Saints, Indulgences granted by the Church, Bede's "petitions, almsgiving, fasting, weeping, and oblation of the saving sacrificial offering by their faithful friends," or the power of the Vow of Amit&acirc;bha, will all be germane to the issue [<a href="#note-2">note</a>].

<P><a href="moral-1.htm#crime"><img src="images/sin.gif" align=left border=0></a>It is noteworthy in this system, however, that there is a moral element involved in addition to faith and grace, let alone pollution, and that indeed is <B>repentance</B>.  Jesus does not just say "Believe," as in, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life" [John 6:47], but we also get, "And that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent:  for the kingdom of heaven is at hand" [Matthew 4:17].  Regardless of whether some purgation is required for sin, the essential step is nevertheless that one in fact repent of sin in the first place.  This addresses the case of people who are willing to do wrongs because they expect to be forgiven for them later.  With such intentions, it is not clear that sincere repentance is likely to follow.  Similarly, the sinner who is confessed and absolved, who intends to do wrongs anyway, in the confidence that he will be confessed and absolved again, cannot be truly penitent over his sins.  He is attempting to game the system.  I expect that Catholics and Protestants would agree that such a person, who does not sincerely repent of sin, cannot be saved.  This ties together morality and salvation in at least one firm way.

<P>Although a dispute for the need for punishment or purgation for evil may be thought of as peculiarly Christian, it is not.  Isl&acirc;m in its early days had to deal with the claims of the <B>Kh&acirc;rijites</B> that anyone guilty of a grave sin was no longer a Moslem.  The Orthodox answer came to be that only the sin of polytheism, which would hardly seem to indicate Isl&acirc;mic religious sentiment anyway, was inconsistent with being a Moslem.  Everyone else was actually saved, although God might punish them for a while prior to admitting them to heaven.  Thus, in properly polynomic fashion, moral goodness varied independently with the means of salvation.  Even more interesting, however, is the case of the <I>J&ocirc;do Shin Sh&ucirc;</I>, <img src="images/hiero/jodo2.gif" align=middle>, the "True Pure Land," Sect of Buddhism in <a href="six.htm#japan">Japan</a>.  Shinran (1174-1268) founded J&ocirc;do Shin in 1224 and taught that rebirth in the Pure Land of the Buddha Amit&acirc;bha (Japanese <I>Amida</I>) could be achieved by no efforts of our own, but only through absolute reliance of the power of the Vow of Amida.  This teaching, together with J&ocirc;do Shin insistence on our own sinfulness and worthlessness, persuaded the later Jesuit missionary in Japan, Alessandro Valignano, that Satan had taught the same heresy to Shinran than he later taught to Martin Luther.  Even birth in the Pure Land, however, although it saves one from the Hells, does not get one entirely off the hook:  &nbsp;the lotus in which one is born does not open immediately for the sinful, and may not open for <a href="gods.htm#note-4"><I>kalpas</I></a>, or millions of years, if one is sufficiently sinful.  And this is in a system of Buddhism that, like Catholicism, has no overt concern for pollution.

<P>The problem of faith versus works often creates the same uneasiness as other manifestations of the polynomic nature of value.  The aesthetic independence of art is bad enough, but many people, or the entire religion of <a href="greek.htm#text-3">Zoroastrianism</a>, find it hard to credit that God, or the Buddha Amida, would reward people with Salvation for anything other than moral goodness.  At the same time, such a teaching addresses an important aspect of the human condition:  &nbsp;people often mean well but do the wrong thing, or feel helpless and worthless in relation to their own desires and temptations.  Some people commit major crimes but then seriously repent of them.  Even if they are willing to face secular retribution for such crimes, they desperately desire an avenue out of eternal punishment.  The promise of salvation by faith alone is that a genuine change of heart, and a proper attitude <I>now</I>, can put things right with Eternity, whether that is thought of as God or the Dharma.  Catholicism and Orthodox Isl&acirc;m thus would seem to represent a certain sophistication, neither denying salvation nor trivializing moral wrongs.  If they do this through a surreptitious use of the dynamic of <I>pollution</I>, that is a tribute to the durability, and usefullness, of the full arsenal of the ancient dimension of religious value.  Luther and Shinran, one might think, represent an overwhelming insight into the polynomic independence of salvation, but an insight that is <I>so</I> overwhelming as to create a moral distortion, like the artist who thinks that moral wrongs are simply excused by the production of good art (as Roman Polanski is excused for raping a drugged and under-age girl).  This seems strongly contrary to Otto's convenient view that Protestantism is the most morally advanced form of religion.

<P><img src="images/mash.jpg" align=right width=275>The successful movie <I>MASH</I>, or <I>M*A*S*H</I> [1970], based on Richard Hooker's book, seriously reduced and rewrote the status and nature of Father John Patrick Mulcahy (played by Ren&eacute; Auberjonois).  He becomes no more than a peripheral and faintly ridiculous, albeit amiable, often bumbling or flustered, character.  The "Swampmen," i.e. Hawkeye (Donald Sutherland, recently the evil President in the <a href="ruling.htm#hunger">Hunger Games</a> movies), Duke (Tom Skerritt, memorable as Captain Dallas in <a href="alien.htm"><I>Alien</I></a>), and Trapper John (Elliott Gould), although not unkind or hostile, do not take him or his religious services seriously.  He is certainly not one of their drinking buddies or fellow conspirators in some of their schemes, as he is in the book.

<P>At one point in the movie, the Father is giving last rites to a patient who has died in the OR.  Hawkeye calls him away, not to help with prayers for his own patient, but actually to assist in the surgery, with a remark that the dead man doesn't need help, but the living patient does.  This incident is not in the book.  Obviously, the implication is that the rites or prayers of the priest are unnecessary and unhelpful.  But that is the opposite of the message in the book (cf. <a href="miracles.htm">On Miracles</a>).  In fact, Father Mulcahy is the equal of the Swampmen in drinking, humor, and gravitas; and when he rebukes them, it is a weightier matter than similar corrections from Colonel Blake.

<P>So, we might wonder, why was the character of Father Mulcahy rewritten so thoroughly for the movie?  Someone doesn't have any respect for religion.  It is not clear whether the director, Robert Altman (1925-2006), is responsible.  I have not otherwise gotten an anti-religious vibe from his other movies, although apparently, if he read the book, he has no problem with the rewrite.  On the other hand, the script for <I>MASH</I> was written by none other than Ring Lardner, Jr. (1915-2000), who was one of the "Hollywood Ten."  They were movie industry insiders called before the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1947 to testify about the presence and influence of Communists in Hollywood (by the way, long before anyone had heard of Senator <a href="satan.htm#note-1">Joe McCarthy</a>).  Lardner, like most of the other witnesses, refused to testify, but he also did not give the Fifth Amendment as a reason for not doing so (as did subsequent figures, like <a href="existent.htm#hammett">Dashiell Hammett</a>).  Thus, he was charged with Contempt of Congress, convicted, and sentenced to prison for it.  Hollywood producers put him on their infamous Black List.  He thus became a martyr and hero of the <a href="antiam.htm">anti-American</a> and anti-anti-Communist (pro-Communist?) <a href="rand.htm#modern">Left</a>.

<P>If Lardner was a Communist, what attitude toward religion would he have?  One not unlike what we see in the movie of <I>MASH</I>.  And it was all gratuitious.  There was otherwise no reason to disparage Father Mulcahy, his beliefs, or his services.  In fact, the hard drinking, realistic, friendly Catholic priest is someone not unfamiliar both in fiction and in the experience of many.  <a href="rand.htm">Ayn Rand</a>, no friend of religion herself, nevertheless complained that HUAC did not allow her to testify about the Communist <I>messages</I> that were being put in Hollywood movies.  <I>MASH</I>, as a clearly anti-war movie in the <a href="perigoku.htm#viet">Vietnam War</a> era, also contains some of those messages.  Father Mulcahy has suffered for it.

<P>Nevertheless, Richard Hooker's attitude towards religion is not uncritical.  When Hawkeye and Duke arrive at the MASH unit, they are sent to bunk with Major Jonathan Hobson, about whom Hooker says, "The fortunes of war had given him a job for which he was unprepared, and associated him with people he could not comprehend" [p.17].  Returning from their first rotation in surgery, Hawkeye and Duke find Hobson on his knees praying.  Duke comments, "I think he's a [Holy] Roller" [<I>ibid.</I>].  Neither Hawkeye nor Duke care much for this, not the least because the Southerner Duke "did not wish to accept salvation from a Yankee evangelist" [p.21].  Hawkeye then tells Colonel Blake to "get that sky pilot out of our tent" [p.22].

<P>Of course, that line is in the movie, but Major Hobson is not.  His entire part was folded into the character of Major Frank Burns, where the objections of the Swampmen, including Trapper John, are more professional and more personal.  Both Duke and Trapper John assault Burns for his incompetence.  Duke's fight was left out of the movie.  The beef about Burns was his incompetence, but it is a reasonable and efficient creative choice that the odium of Major Hobson should be coupled with him.

<P>But it is noteworthy that Duke was annoyed that Hobson was a "<a href="presiden.htm#yankee">Yankee</a>."  Duke's background also comes up in relation to Father Mulcahy, after he began to help in the OR:

<P><blockquote>This was all to the good, except that Duke Forrest became somewhat bothered.  Protestantism was strong in him, and close association with an accredited representative of the opposition caused occasional qualms. [p.37]</blockquote>

<P>Duke even asks Father Mulcahy if "one of my boys couldn't do as well?" [<I>ibid.</I>].  Mulcahy actually answers, "I'm sure he could" [p.38].  Unfortunately, the Protestant Chaplain was "Shaking Sammy," whose "fixes" were ineffective and who was otherwise more than a bit of a fool.  "Guess I'll have to stick with the bead-jiggler," concluded Duke [<I>ibid.</I>].

<P>Duke and Hawkeye then decide to offer a tribute to Father Mulcahy by burning "Shaking Sammy" as a human sacrifice [p.39].  With real gasoline, they could have done it, but it was, of course, a joke.  But it was not well received by Sammy, of course, or Colonel Blake, who tried to arrest them, or Father Mulcahy, who, "disillusioned and disapponted," rebuked the Swampmen.  Hawkeye has an interesting answer:

<P><blockquote>I'm perfectly serious now.  I'm not going to apologize to Shaking Sammy.  I despise quack doctors, and for the same good reasons I despise quack sky pilots and all the screwballs on the fringe of the do-gooding business.  So forget it. [p.42]</blockquote>

<P>This, indeed, is a perfectly sensible statement.  No part of the incident, of course, is in the movie.  And it is also obvious that Hawkeye does not consider Father Mulcahy one of these "quack sky pilots."  The dislike for Major Hobson or "Shaking Sammy" is not a general condemnation of religion, and of the Swampmen we are given to understand that Duke actually takes his own religion with some seriousness.  That is part of his problem, for better or worse, with both Father Mulcahy and Major Hobson.

<H3 align=center>The New Friesian Theory of Religious Value, Note 2</H3>

<p><center><img src="images/key.gif"></center>

<P><img src="images/greek/holy.gif" align=middle>, <I>h&aacute;gios</I>, and <img src="images/greek/hagnos.gif" align=middle>, <I>hagn&oacute;s</I>, both derive from <img src="images/greek/the-neut.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/hagos.gif" align=middle>, <I>h&aacute;gos</I> (genitive, <img src="images/greek/hageos.gif" align=middle>, <I>h&aacute;geos</I>), "any matter of religious awe; that which requires expiation, a curse, pollution, guilt; the person or thing accursed, an abomination; an expiation; in a good sense, =<img src="images/greek/sebas.gif" align=middle>, awe."  Note that <img src="images/greek/sebas.gif" align=middle>, <I>s&eacute;bas</I> (neuter, no genitive or plurals), is "reverential awe, a feeling of awe; generally, reverence, worship; the object of awe, holiness, majesty; and object of wonder, a wonder."   From that we get the Greek equivalent of Latin <I>augustus</I>, <img src="images/greek/sebasto2.gif" align=middle>, <I>sebast&oacute;s</I>, "reverenced, august."

<P>The curious thing about <img src="images/greek/hagos.gif" align=middle> is that it encompasses the <I>opposites</I> of "religious awe" and "pollution" or a "curse."  This might reinforce the idea in James Frazer, as we will see, that these are the same thing, and, "The uncleanness, as it is called, of girls at puberty and the sanctity of holy men do not, to the primitive mind, differ materially from each other."  The simple meaning of "religious awe," derived from the verb <img src="images/greek/hazomai.gif" align=middle>, <I>h&aacute;zomai</I>, "to stand in awe of, dread," however, might apply generally to any supernatural phenomenon, which would indeed include holiness and also curses and pollution.  We see this ambiguity in English with the words "awful" and "awesome," which could mean the same thing, but don't (or not any more).  <a href="moral-1.htm#expiate">Expiation</a>, in turn, takes someone cursed or polluted and restores them to purity, who then qualifies to be associated with sacred things.

<P>The word <img src="images/greek/hagnos.gif" align=middle> ends up with a meaning a little different from <img src="images/greek/holy.gif" align=middle>.  Thus, Liddell & Scott say that it means, "full of religious awe; hallowed, holy, sacred; chase, pure; pure from blood, guiltess; pure, upright."  The senses here of purity, the chaste, guiltless, etc. lead to the New Testament use of <img src="images/greek/the-fem.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/chastity.gif" align=middle>, <I>hagn&oacute;t&ecirc;s</I> "purity, chastity" (genitive, <img src="images/greek/chastitg.gif" align=middle>, <I>hagn&oacute;t&ecirc;tos</I>), which we see among the seven "<a href="key.htm#note">heavenly virtues</a>."  We also get the nice New Testament term <img src="images/greek/hagiosyn.gif" align=middle>, <I>hagios&yacute;n&ecirc;</I>, "holiness, sanctity," which goes back to <img src="images/greek/holy.gif" align=middle>.

<P>The multiple words for "awe" here may excite some curiosity about the reason for their multiplicity, and so the ways in which the meanings may differ.  As we have seen, <img src="images/greek/hagos.gif" align=middle> begins with religious awe but then shades over into curses and pollution, and back again.  In this there is some similarity to <img src="images/greek/the-neut.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/deos.gif" align=middle>, <I>d&eacute;os</I> (genitive, <img src="images/greek/deous.gif" align=middle>, <I>d&eacute;ous</I>), "fear, alarm, affright; awe, reverence."  Awe and reverence now have overtones of fear, which would be appropriate for any powerful or supernatural phenomenon, but without quite the same negative valence as with <img src="images/greek/hagos.gif" align=middle>.  On the other hand, from <img src="images/greek/deos.gif" align=middle> we have the derived adjective <img src="images/greek/deinos.gif" align=middle>, <I>dein&oacute;s</I>, "fearful, terrible, dread, dire; mighty, powerful; wondrous, marvellous, strange; powerful, wondrous, able, clever, skilful."  Here we have something that begins very negative but then drifts back into "wondrous" and even "clever."  This is a remarkable range of meanings, although when <a href="archon.htm#constantine">Theophanes Confessor</a> talks about the <img src="images/greek/allterri.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/kaka.gif" align=middle>, <I>p&aacute;ndeina kak&aacute;</I>, "all terrible evils," his meaning is in no doubt.

<P>Then we have <img src="images/greek/sebas.gif" align=middle>, which is "reverential awe," etc. apparently without the negative or frightening associations or connections.  Thus, <img src="images/greek/sebasto2.gif" align=middle> conveys a sense of majesty without any threat or cause for worry.  It is "awe" without reservations.

<H3 align=center>The New Friesian Theory of Religious Value, Note 3</H3>

<p><center><img src="images/key.gif"></center>

<P>There is another word in Greek that can mean "hallowed" and so perhaps "holy," along with <img src="images/greek/holy.gif" align=middle>.  That would be <img src="images/greek/pious.gif" align=middle>, <I>h&oacute;sios</I>, with its opposite, <img src="images/greek/impious.gif" align=middle>, <I>an&oacute;sios</I>.  We quickly see that we are dealing with something different from <img src="images/greek/holy.gif" align=middle> and <img src="images/greek/sacred.gif" align=middle>, however, when these words are applied to individuals:  &nbsp;<img src="images/greek/pious.gif" align=middle> is "pious, devout, religious" [Liddell & Scott, <I>Intermediate Greek Lexicon</I>, p.572], while <img src="images/greek/impious.gif" align=middle> is "impious."  The <img src="images/greek/pious.gif" align=middle> individual is not himself holy or sacred, but he is cognizant and observant of the holy.  Thus, the entire discussion of Plato's <a href="euthyph.htm#four"><I>Euthyphro</I></a> is about <img src="images/greek/piousn.gif" align=middle> and <img src="images/greek/impiousn.gif" align=middle>, "the pious" and "the impious" [5d], and <img src="images/greek/piety.gif" align=middle> is just "piety" or "the service owed by man to God."

<P>But there are other interesting aspects to <img src="images/greek/pious.gif" align=middle>.  Liddell & Scott report that it means, not just "hallowed," but "sanctioned by the law of God," contrasted with <img src="images/greek/dikaios.gif" align=middle>, the right and just "sanctioned by <I>human</I> law."  This is what we would expect from the pious.  But there is something else.  They say that <img src="images/greek/pious.gif" align=middle> also contrasts with <img src="images/greek/sacred.gif" align=middle> in the sense that it is "<I>permitted</I> or <I>not forbidden by divine law</I>," i.e. "profane," Latin <I>profanus</I>.  Thus, the semantic range of <img src="images/greek/pious.gif" align=middle> would seem to encompass what <I>excludes</I> the impious, the polluted, or the unholy.  This is especially striking when we find in Liddell & Scott the definition for <img src="images/greek/impious.gif" align=middle> as not just "unholy" but also "<I>profane</I>, Lat. <I>profanus</I>" [p.74].  So, acccording to Liddell & Scott, <I>both</I> <img src="images/greek/pious.gif" align=middle> and <img src="images/greek/impious.gif" align=middle> mean <I>profanus</I>, a remarkable identity.  There is clearly some confusion here, which depends on the proper meaning of <I>profanus</I>.

<P><I>Cassell's New Latin Dictionary</I> [Funk & Wagnalls, 1960], defines <I>profanus</I> as "<I>lying before a temple</I>, i.e. <I>outside it</I>; hence, <I>not sacred, ordinary, common, profane</I>" [p.476].  Now, it is possible that <img src="images/greek/pious.gif" align=middle> has a different range of meaning than <I>profanus</I>, but we may feel some concern or confusion if it ends up that <img src="images/greek/pious.gif" align=middle> and <img src="images/greek/impious.gif" align=middle> can mean the same thing, when Socrates obviously sees them as opposites, as we might imagine from the form of the words (although this doesn't work with "flammable" and "infammable," which mean the same thing in English).  The key perhaps is that there is part of the range of "profane" that is <I>neither</I> holy <I>nor</I> unholy, <I>neither</I> sacred <I>nor</I> polluted.  If <img src="images/greek/pious.gif" align=middle> contrast both with <img src="images/greek/sacred.gif" align=middle> and with what is "forbidden by divine law," then it fits in that range.

<H3 align=center>The New Friesian Theory of Religious Value, Note 4</H3>

<p><center><img src="images/key.gif"></center>

<P>The French <I>sacr&eacute;</I> is a past participle from <I>sacrer</I>, a verb which now means "to anoint, to crown" as well as "consecrate," but also "to curse and swear."  We can use participles, of course, as adjectives, which is how we usually see <I>sacr&eacute;</I>.

<P>It is irrelevant to our worries about the sacred, but I see some similar modifications of endings happening in other English borrowings.  English has "<a href="flanders.htm">Flanders</a>" where French has <I>Flandre</I>.  Why the "s"?  Well, Flanders is a plural in Dutch <I>Vlaanderen</I>.  So English uses a plural.  More intriguing is English "<a href="italia.htm#naples">Naples</a>."  Again, why the "s"?  Well <I>Napoli</I> in Italian looks like a plural, because it ends in "i."  But it isn't a plural.  The "i" is an artifact of the name in Greek, <img src="images/greek/neapolis.gif" align=middle>.  So English sailors, from whom "Naples" certainly derives, who probably didn't know Greek, reacted to the appearance of the name in Italian.

<P>In French we also get the occasional puzzle with plurals, since "London" turns up as <I>Londres</I>, with an "s."  "London" does not seem to have ever been a plural, in English or Latin (<I>Londinium</I>), so I have no explanation why it would be a plural in French.

<P><img src="images/socrates.jpg" align=left>While Socrates is ugly and beautiful in very different respects, i.e. inside vs. outside, there is also the experience of things or people that seem to be ugly overall or beautiful overall but have some beautiful or ugly <I>feature</I> that redeems or compromises, respectively, the effect.  This can leave some uncertainty or ambivalence about the impression of the whole.  In such cases, and even where no particular contrary feature can be identified, an initial impression of beauty can progress to an impression of ugliness, while an initial impression of ugliness or plainness can progress to an impression of beauty.  The later is what we see in Jane Austen's <I>Pride and Prejudice</I>, where Mr. Darcy's first impression of Elizabeth Bennett is that "She is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt <I>me</I>" [1813, Penguin, 1972, p.59].  Later we find him saying of her, "for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance' [p.290].  How it is that such progressions occur is a good question.  With people, it often seems that their expressions and manner are taken to reveal such characteristics of their personality that put what may be indifferent features in a different light, as it were.  With Darcy, he remarks that Elizabeth's "fine eyes" began to attract him; but the reader, like Elizabeth herself, is free to judge that Elizabeth, who was already regarded by most as good looking, actually began to appeal to Darcy more as her personality was revealed through conversation and other social interaction.  She grew on him.

<I>The Virgin Spring</I> (<I>Jungfruk&auml;llan</I>), by Ingmar Bergman, 1960</H3>

<p><center><img src="images/key.gif"></center>

<P>The classic movie <I>The Virgin Spring</I>, by <a href="existent.htm#bergman">Ingmar Bergman</a>, is a nice example of crime, vengeance, and expiation in religion.  <B>Max von Sydow</B> (still active in 2016 in HBO's <I>Game of Thrones</I>, after a cameo in the new 2015 <I>Star Wars</I> movie) has a daughter, played by Birgitta Pettersson, who, while traveling to take candles to a church, is raped and murdered by two herdsmen.  The herdsmen, along with a young boy who witnessed the crime in horror and terror, end up coincidentally lodging at the home of the father himself.  When von Sydow discovers that his daughter has been murdered, by these men, he personally kills all of them, including the boy, despite his obvious youth and terror.  He and his wife then go and find their daughter's body.  As von Syndow lifts the girl, a spring comes into being at the spot.  Consumed by grief over his daughter, and distraught with the realization that he has himself killed an innocent boy, the father vows to build a church on the spot -- the spot of the miraculous "virgin spring."

<P>A key element here is, not just the miracle and the church in tribute to the girl's innocence, but the expiation of the father's own crime and sin in killing the boy.  Secular justice is unlikely to sanction him, and so his contrition, remorse, and penance must do the job both of punishment and expiation.  Religion is the only consolation he has for anything that has happened.

<P>A counterpoint in the movie is the servant (Gunnel Lindblom) who travels with the daughter, but is viciously jealous of her.  She secretly still worships Odin, whom she seems to actually meet on the road.  She also ends up penitent, confessing to von Sydow that she had wished for his daughter's death, which the encounter with Odin may actually have effected (although she fled from him).  The servant's paganism thus may represent the evil influences, human or supernatural, that overtake the girl.
