<P>The following table, like the companion file, <a href="distanc2.htm" target="_top">"If a Millimeter Were a Year/Light-Year"</a>, attempts to provide some perspective on cosmological distance and time.  This table foreshortens distance by using a logarithmic scale, while "If a Millimeter Were a Year/Light-Year" keeps distance and time to scale.  Thus distant objects crowd up in this table but are spread out (over thousands of miles in the model) on the other.  In each, distance is somewhat at a disadvantage, since a light year is already a greater distance than is easily comprehended, while a year in time is familar to all.  On the other hand, since a year <I>is</I> so commonplace, this puts into perspective both the nearby stellar distances and the greath depths of geological time and cosmological distance.

<P>Clicking on the link to the footnotes will usually open a popup <B>window</B> on the note.  This new window can be closed.  If it is not, if it is minimized or overlain, the next footnote will appear in a new popup, and all the new popup windows will begin to accumulate.  It would thus be better to close the popups as they open.  All the footnotes are at the bottom of this page.

<P>The "present" in this table is 1993.  This dates to my teaching time at <a href="./valley/">Los Angeles Valley College<a>.  The "present" could be updated to when I write now, in 2018, but it would not improve the idea or the impression.

<P>A discussion of sources may be found in <a href="distanc2.htm" target="_top">"If a Millimeter Were a Year/Light-Year"</a>.

<P><center><img src="images/key-9.gif"></center>

<P>Alpha Centauri (or <img src="images/greek/alpha.gif"> Cen) is the closest star to the Sun, and the third brightest star in the sky (after Sirius and Canopus), but it is too far south in the sky to be seen from the continental United States.  It is a system of three stars.  The dimmest of those, Alpha Centauri C, or Proxima Centauri, in orbit around the other two, is presently the closest to the sun.

<P>The central double star of Alpha Centauri consists of Alpha Centauri A, or Rigel Kentaurus, which is 1.1 solar masses, and Alpha Centauri B, which is 0.907 solar masses.  At closest approach (periastron) they are 11.2 Astronomical Units apart; and when furthest apart (apastron) they are 35.6 AU apart.  They revolve around each other with a period of 79.91 years.  Their distance from the Sun is now measured at 4.37 light years.

<P>Alpha Centauri C orbits AB with a periastron of 4300 Astronomical Units, an apastron of 13,000 AU, and with a period of about 550,000 years.  These extraordinary distances and orbital period left the question open whether C was even part of the Alpha Centauri system.  Only in 2017 was it positively shown that C was indeed in orbit around the other two.  Meanwhile, C lies between AB and the Earth and is only 4.24 light years away.  This makes it the closest star to the Sun, and its slow orbital speed means that it will maintain this status for a multiple of many times the sum of human historical time (only about 5000 years).  Alpha Centauri C is a red dwarf star, with only 0.123 solar masses, and is too dim to be seen with the naked eye.  Nevertheles, a planet has been identified in orbit around the star.

<P>I was perplexed for many years that Proxima Centauri was said to be both the closest star and in orbit around the other two.  Wouldn't it be further away in other parts of its orbit?  Well, yes; but we might need to wait half a million years for that.  The only time I have seen Alpha Centauri was while living in <a href="hawaii.htm">Hawai'i</a>, especially when that was right across the Kalaniana'ole Highway, looking south out over the dark ocean.  Pretty much zero light pollution.  Alpha and Beta Centauri, and the Southern Cross, were conspicuous.

<P>A <B>Light Year</B> (LY) is the distance light can travel in a year.  The velocity of light (usually symbolized with "<B>c</B>") in a vacuum is <B>299,792,458 m/s</B> <I>by definition</I> (the length of the meter is then based on this).  This means a Light Year is <B>9,460,528,401,200 km</B>.  This <I>Astronomical Almanac</I> for 2018 gives the mean length of the tropical year (from equinox to equinox) as <B>365d 05h 48m 45.2s</B>.  Multiplying that out likely will produce a different length of the Light Year in kilometers, since the previous calculation was done some years ago, with an earlier value for the tropical year.  Beyond nine trillion kilometers, however, one might wonder how much difference it would make.

<P>The <B>Parsec</B> is often used in astronomy instead of the Light Year.  A Parsec (Parallax Second or PC) is the distance of an object from the sun such that the triangle whose base is the distance from the earth to the sun (called the Astronomical Unit, AU, au, or ua) makes an angle of one second of arc at the object.  This means that a Parsec is equal to the <B>cotangent</B> of one arc second, in Astronomical Units = <B>206264.8 AU</B>.

<P><center><img src="images/greek/parsec.gif"></center>

<P>The Astronomical Unit is now defined as exactly <B>149,597,870,700 m</B>, which makes a Parsec <B>30.85677581 x 10<sup>12</sup> km</B> (or 30.85677581 Pm or petameters).  A Parsec is thus <B>3.26163 LY</B>.

<P>In the original <a href="starwars.htm"><I>Star Wars</I></a> the Parsec was used as though it was a unit of <I>time</I> rather than distance.  <B>Carl Sagan</B> complained about this on the <I>Tonight Show</I>, telling Johnny Carson that all they needed was an "impecunious graduate student" from astronomy to prevent them from making those kinds of mistakes.  Unfortunately, when it comes to the history of science, even people with Ph.D.'s in astronomy or physics often introduce or perpetuate falsehoods -- for instance about the existence of <a href="kant.htm#note-2" target="_top">external galaxies</a> or the experimental refutation of Aristotle's theory of <a href="hist-1.htm#impetus" target="_top">falling bodies</a>.  And although Hollywood often hires experts to advise them on movies, their advice is not always taken.

<P>In the old days of shows like <I>The Twilight Zone</I>, very little care was taken with distances, and expressions like "billions of miles" were sometimes used with the implication of encompassing interstellar distances, when that might only barely get us out of the solar system.  More recently, a movie in the <a href="alien.htm" target="_top">Alien</a> series, <I>Prometheus</I> [2012], begins with a ship that is said to be 3.27 x 10<sup>14</sup> km from Earth.  This would give us the equivalent of 35 Light Years, which is about the distance to the star Arcturus.  This would be a credible distance if the technology ever develops to allow exploration of nearby areas in the galaxy, although the technology for this kind of space travel, which would require faster-than-light cruising, is never discussed in the movies of this series, and we are also never given any kind of idea about the proximity of this location to the Earth in relation to the size and structure of the galaxy.  Of course, as George Lucas realized, it is better to leave these details unaddressed if they would not be in the internal natural discourse of the science fiction world.

<P>Open Clusters are young stars that have recently blown away the dust and gas from the nebula in which they condensed.  In time the stars scatter and become isolated, like the sun.  The Hyades take up a large part of the constellation Taurus and are close enough that they do not look conspicuously cluster-like to the naked eye.  The Hyades are also just within the radius of the <I>Local Bubble</I>:  the spherical void space, probably cleared by an ancient supernova, surrounded by denser dust and gas, within which the sun and other local stars move.  Counting down no further than magnitude 8 in brightness, the Local Bubble contains no less than 5000 stars.  Other voids within the Orion Arm of the Galaxy abut on the Local Bubble.

<P>The Great Orion Nebula, covering about one degree of arc, is part of one the principal areas of star formation in the Orion (or Local) Arm of the Galaxy.  <I>Diffuse</I> nebulae are large bodies of dust and gas.  <I>Bright</I> diffuse nebulae scatter blue starlight or are excited by starlight to glow red.  <I>Dark</I> nebulae can be identified by the way they block light from background stars, or bright nebulae, behind them.  New stars condense within these nebulae.  Some nebulae, although invisible to the naked eye, cover relatively large parts of the sky.  The North America Nebula stretches across 2.5 degrees of arc, which is <I>five times</I> the diameter of the sun or the moon.

<P>Many nearby galaxies, including our own, are headed towards a concentration of mass equal to 100,000 Milky Ways, dubbed The Great Attractor.  Abell 3627, which matches The Great Attractor in direction and distance, has recently been suggested as a candidate, though its visible mass is only about 10% of what it would need to be.

<H4 ALIGN="center">Comparison of Cosmological Distances with Historical and Geological Time, Note 28;<br>The Red Shift</H4>

<p><center><img src="images/key-9.gif"></center>

<P>The Red Shift from the Doppler Effect is how we actually <I>know</I> about the radial velocity of recession, and distance, of galaxies.  The Red Shift (z) is the change in a wavelength of radiation (<img src="images/delta.gif"><img src="images/lambda.gif">) from the object divided by what the original wavelength was (<img src="images/delta.gif"><img src="images/lambda.gif">/<img src="images/lambda.gif">).  This can be related to velocity (u) as:  (z+1)<sup>2</sup>=(c+u)/(c-u) or u/c=(z<sup>2</sup>+2z)/(z<sup>2</sup>+2z+2), where c=1.  Distance (s) then depends on Hubble's Law:  u=sH, where the Hubble Constant (H) is taken to be 75 km/s/MPC (it is somewhere between 50 and 100 km/s/MPC).  1/H is the Hubble Time, which for the given H is 13.04 Gy.  c/H, the Hubble Radius, is thus 13.04 GLY.  At low values, z is virtually identical to u/c.  This is the point where the two values begin to diverge.  u/c cannot be larger than 1, but z can be any number up to infinity (at the speed of light).

<P>The June 2010 edition of <I>Sky & Telescope</I> reports the Hubble Constant to be 70.4 +/- 1.4 km/s/MPC [p.14].  They also report the age of the universe to be 13.75 +/- 0.11 years.  It used to be that the Hubble Time would be larger than the age of the universe; but if the expansion of the universe in accelerating, then the Hubble Time is smaller than the age of the universe.

<P>Quasars (Quasi-Stellar Objects, or QSO's) are among the most mysterious objects in the universe.  Small, distant, and incredibly bright, their energy output (a mass the size of the moon is turned into energy every second) and their absence from nearby space are largely unexplained.  Some quasars appear to be in the middle of galaxies, and it is theorized that they all are.  Their strangeness leads some astronomers to argue that they are really <I>not</I> so distant and that their red shift is from some other effect, but that theory hasn't work out very well.  3C [the Third Cambridge Catalogue of Radio Sources] 273 is actually one of the intrinsically brightest Quasars, and it is relatively close, as close as many observable galaxies.  If we were to bring it merely as close as the star Arcturus, it would appear as bright as the sun in the sky.
