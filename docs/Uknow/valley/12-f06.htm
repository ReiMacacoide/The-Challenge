<I>CONTENTS:</I>  The course is intended as a survey of the Ancient Western
           Philosophy that was written in the Greek and, to an extent, the
           Latin languages.  This divides into three periods, <b>Greek
           Philosophy</B>, <B>Hellenistic Philosophy</B> (which includes the early
           Roman period), and <B>Philosophy in Late Antiquity</B> (i.e. the Late
           Roman Empire).  But emphasis will be on the first period.

        Unit 1:  The Presocratics; Tentative Quiz, September 27

        Unit 2:  Greek Humanism, the Sophists, and Socrates;
                 Tentative midterm, October 25

        Unit 3:  Plato and Aristotle; Tentative Quiz November 22

        Unit 4:  Philosophy in the Hellenistic Period and Late Antiquity
                 Final:  Wednesday, December 20, 6:45 PM, CC 205.

<I>ATTENDANCE:</I>  This is primarily a <I>lecture</I> class:  tardiness
     and absences thus will result in missing material that cannot be found
     in the texts <I>or</I> in other sources.  The texts are primary sources
     which are not self-explanatory; and you will <I><B>not</B></I> find what I talk
     about in encyclopaedia articles or in most other books.  Believe me,
     you <I><B>will not do well</B></I> in the class unless you are present for the
     lectures or arrange to obtain lecture notes, and it is <I>your
     responsibility</I> to arrange with others to obtain the materials for
     classes that you miss.  You may tape record lectures.

     Attendance is <B><I>no longer</I></B> taken for each class meeting.  No student
     will be excluded for non-attendance after the first three weeks.  Do
     not report absences to me.  It is your own responsibility to drop the
     class if you wish to do so (final drop date:  <B>November 26th</B>).  Anyone
     on the roster at the end of the semester who has not been present for
     the tests will receive an F.  It is your responsibility to obtain from
     other students any material or assignments you miss when absent.  If
     you miss any examinations, including the due date for take home exams,
     and you return within the period when a makeup is allowed, you must be
     prepared to take the test, or hand in any materials, promptly at the
     beginning of the class on the day you return.

     Holidays this semester are Veteran's Day, November 10; and
     Thanksgiving, November 23-24.  The last day of classes is December 14.

     Note well:  Anyone who persistently disrupts my class by talking,
     arriving late, leaving early, repeatedly leaving & returning, or
     through any other distracting or inconsiderate behavior may be
     instructed to leave the class.  If you do not want to be here,
     don't come in the first place.

<I>OFFICE HOURS:</I>  My office hours are MW 7:30-8:00 & 11:10-11:45 AM, TuWTh
    6:30-6:45 PM, and by appointment in CC 224.  The phone number is (818)
    <B>947-2467</B>.  This is a direct line, and no one else will answer the phone.
    You should call during office hours.  If you call at other times, you
    can leave messages on <B>voicemail</B>.  Do <B><I>not</I></B> report absences, or your
    reasons for them, by voicemail.  Do not leave messages for me to call
    <B><I>you</I></B>, without the <B><I>times</I></B> you can be reached at your number.  I will not
    return calls if all you want is to be brought up to date for classes
    you have missed.  Any inquiries by e-mail can be answered within a
    couple of days:  <B>DrKelley@AOL.com</B>.  Identify the class in the subject
    line of the e-mail.

<I>TESTS:</I>  There will be one midterm exam, two quizzes, and a final.  The
    major exams will include multiple choice, short answer identifications,
    and essay questions.  The two quizzes will be all multiple choice.  The
    final will be <I>comprehensive</I>.  Make-up tests and quizzes will only be
    given until the exams are handed back.  If you miss a test, you
    <B><I>must</I></B> take the make-up the day that you return.  <I>Do not</I> ask to make
    up a test weeks after it has been given.  If you miss the final and
    cannot take it at another time I have scheduled, you cannot make it up
    during the current semester and will be credited with an F <I>unless</I> you
    request an <I>Incomplete</I>--which you may do simply by leaving a <B><I>message</I></B>
    for me <I>before</I> I turn in the grades.

    Point values are assigned to grades as follows:  F=0, D=3, C=6, B=9,
    A=12.  Minuses subtract one point, and pluses add one.  A C+ is thus
    worth 7. The grade on the final exam will be multiplied by two
    (Midterm I + Midterm II = Final).  The lowest midterm grade (or an F
    for a missed midterm) will be dropped <I>if</I> the grade is improved
    by the substitution of the grade of the other midterm or of the final
    <U><B>with the penalty of one letter grade</B></U> (sub-tracting 3
    points).  For instance, an A+ (13) on the final means that a
    midterm grade lower than a B+ (10) is replaced with a B+.  If the
    course grade is as much as 10 (B+), <I>without rounding</I>, an A will
    be awarded.  If a 7 (C+), a B; a 4 (D+), a C; and a 1 (F+), a D.

    In all tests in my classes, you are not expected to <I>agree</I> with
    me on any issue; but you <I>are</I> expected to know what has been
    presented in the course, both in the lectures and in the books, and to
    present reasons or arguments for any views you wish to advocate.
    Outside materials or opinions are welcome so long as they are not a
    <I>substitute</I> for awareness or discussion of the materials of the
    course.

    You are expected to do your own work, so do not prepare common essays
    with your study partners.  On a test, if I read an essay that I have
    already read, I <I>will</I> grade it down.  Do not simply reproduce the
    handouts or quote from them without attribution.  I reserve the
    right to <I><B>exclude</B></I> or <I><B>fail</B></I> anyone who turns in work that they have not
    done themselves, who plagiarizes, or who cheats in any other way.  I
    apologize in advance for the security measures it has become necessary
    to take to guard against cheating on examinations.  This is irritating
    and insulting for us all.
