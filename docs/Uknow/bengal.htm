In 1765, Robert Clive obtained from the Moghul Emperor Sh&acirc;h '&Acirc;lam II, who was a fugitive in British care, a grant of the <I>Diwani</I>, or revenue responsiblity for the province of Bengal.  This made the British East India Company, as the Diwan of Bengal, part of the consitutional order of the Moghul Empire, and is often considered the beginning of British Rule, the "R&acirc;j," in India.  However, Clive had no intention of replacing the Naww&acirc;bs, and the Company intended to leave local officials in place to collect the actual revenues of Bengal.

<P>The next step occurred in 1772, when Warren Hastings, as the first British Governor General of India, moved to take over in all its details the functions of the <I>Diwani</I>.  At the same time, the British informally took over the <I>Nizamat</I>, the criminal and police administration of Bengal, including the courts, leaving the Naww&acirc;b with no remaining public duties.  He was, however, left unmolested with his pension at the capital of Murshidabad.  The <I>Nizamat</I> was not <I>formally</I> assumed by the Company until 1793.

<P>The Naww&acirc;b at least remained so <I>in name</I> until 1880, when Mansur Ali Khan, the last Naww&acirc;b of Bengal, was deposed.  His son, however, Hassan Ali Mirza Khan Bahadur, succeeded with the title Naww&acirc;b of Murshidabad.  This line of Naww&acirc;bs continued until 1969, when the main line died out and the succession was left in dispute.

<P>The first President of Pakistan in 1956, Iskander Mirza, was the son of Mohammad Fateh Ali, the grandson of Bahadur Syed Iskander Ali, and the great grandson of no less than the Naww&acirc;b Mansur Ali Khan.
