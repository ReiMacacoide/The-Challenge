Burnet's gloss on <I>Apology</I> 41d,<br>

<P><a name="text-1">John Burnet [<a href="#biblio">1</a>] considers <I>ap&ecirc;ll&aacute;khthai pragm&aacute;t&ocirc;n</I> [<img src="../images/greek/41d.gif" align=middle>] colloquial and renders it "to rest from my labours" [<a href="#note-1">note</a>].  By citing 22a7, Burnet recognizes that Socrates views the divine mission as a Herculean task.  James Riddell's appeal to Xenophon <I>Apology</I> 32  ("the wants and hardships of old age") [<a href="#biblio">8</a>, p.107, n.20] is dismissed.  Does any translator follow Burnet?  
Grube has "escape from trouble" but does not specify what the trouble is  [<a href="#biblio">4</a>].  Gallop relegates his agreement with Riddell to a footnote [<a href="#biblio">3</a>]; West to a comment [<a href="#biblio">12</a>, p. 230, n. 18).  Gallop hedges with "probably" -- West with "may" [<a href="#biblio">3</a>, p.103].  Wagner quotes Riddell after citing <I>Republic</I> 406e (""pragmaton denotes human life in its stir and commotions") [<a href="#biblio">11</a>, p.111]. 

<P>Tredennick has "released from my distractions" but does not cite what these are or by whom [<a href="#biblio">10</a>, p.75].  Jowett has "released from trouble" [<a href="#biblio">5</a>, p.84].  Here "released" in the sense of manumit permits reference to <I>Cratylus</I> 404e-406a.  Apollo "washes" away "evil impurities" and "releases [<I>apol&uacute;&ocirc;n</I>, <img src="../images/greek/apoluon.gif" align=middle>] us" from them.  Apollo is "the one who destroys" [<a href="#biblio">7</a>, p.38 and n.64].  Apollo is the terminator.

<P><a name="text-2">At 20c5 Socrates describes the divine mission as his <I>pr&acirc;gma</I> [<img src="../images/greek/pragma.gif" align=middle>], i.e., his business.  Burnet observes that <I>pr&acirc;gma</I> can mean "philosophy regarded as a 'way of life'."  <I>Phaedo</I> 61c8 and <I>Theaetetus</I> 168a8 are cited.  When Socrates emphasizes that he will defy a court order to cease and desist from the divine mission (29d), he states that he will not give up the practice of philosophy.   Hence:  the divine mission = Socrates' <I>pr&acirc;gma</I>  = Socrates' practice of philosophy =  Socrates' "journeyings as if they were labours" = Socrates' investigation in the service of the god and includes troubles caused by the divine mission (slander, enmity, unpopularity, loss of leisure, neglect of family, poverty).  Burnet notes that Socrates  continues until he is released, citing <I>Phaedo</I> 62c7 [<a href="#note-2">note</a>].

<P>From this the following conclusion is obtained:  (*) ... it is better for me to die now and be released from the divine mission which is terminated by Apollo.  In addition  (*)  constitutes the answer Socrates ought to give to Crito's objections (at <I>Crito</I> 45e) about going to court, the handling of the trial, and "this absurd ending."  Plato does not allow Socrates to address these charges directly.  The students in the Academy are expected to do this for homework.

<P>Burnet says [p.171, n.41d4]:

<P><blockquote><img src="../images/greek/41d.gif" align=middle> almost 'to rest from my labours', though the phrase is quite colloquial.  I cannot believe that it refers to the tourbles of old age, a Riddell suggests.  That is Xenophon's ideas, not Plato's.  I should rather compare 22 a 7 <img src="../images/greek/22a7.gif">.</blockquote>

<P>Given Burnet's gloss on 20c5, an appeal to <I>Strong's Greek Dictionary</I> [<a href="#biblio">9</a>] strengthens the claim that <I>pragm&aacute;t&ocirc;n</I> represents the divine mission.  Strong connects <I>pr&acirc;gma</I> with <I>pragm&aacute;t&ocirc;n</I> (the genitive plural) as well as <I>pragmate&iacute;a</I> [<img src="../images/greek/pragmate.gif" align=middle>] (an enterprise that requires diligence), also employed as a description of philosophy.  Cf. Strong's 4229, 4230, 4231.

<P>Also, Liddell and  Scott [<a href="#biblio">6</a>] s.v. <img src="../images/greek/pragma.gif" align=middle>, "III. in pl. <img src="../images/greek/pragmata.gif" align=middle>," <img src="../images/greek/41d.gif" align=middle> translated as "to be quit of <I>the business of life</I>" [<I>Intermediate Lexicon</I>, pp.665-666].  This long antedates the modern translations of "trouble," including Jowett, and Burnet's objection to them.

<P>Compare "Aristotle's <I>Metaphysics</I> 987a30:  &nbsp;<I>he Pl&aacute;tonos... pagmate&iacute;a</I>, "Plato's system."  The present author recalls that Prof. Gregory Vlastos, when asked about <I>ap&ecirc;ll&aacute;khthai pragm&aacute;t&ocirc;n</I>, stated, "be done with this thing" [NEH Seminar, "The Philosophy of Socrates," Summer 1981].  Readers who discover a translation containing "rest from my labours" are requested to email <a href="mailto:ravitch@lavc.edu">ravitch@lavc.edu</a>.
