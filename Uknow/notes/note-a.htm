<P>It may be objected that no philosophical realist really believes that things are "just as we see them"; but the point here will be to start with the naive origins of all realism.  The qualifications common to any sensible philosophical realism are responses to observations which result in <I>different</I> kinds of realism and which, taken far enough, actually may lead to anti-realism or phenomenalism.  Here all that counts is what originally and ultimately all the realisms have in common.

<P>cf. D.M. Amstrong, <I>Belief Truth and Knowledge</I> (Cambridge 1973), pp. 152-161 "The Infinite Regress of Reasons."  The "externalist" resolution of the regress, prefered by Armstrong, attempts to justify knowledge with something (causality) that is not even a cognitive relation.  The Friesian solution is that the ground of non-inferential justification is simply not a belief, which puts the matter outside Armstrong's frame-of-reference altogether, although he looks for something <I>like</I> that with his externalism.

<P>The basis in the sense that the argument "from the possibility of experience" for synthetic <I>a priori</I> knowledge (through the categories) depends on this unity (the object) being a necessary condition of experience, while the function of synthesis is a necessary condition of the unity, while the categories are a necessary condition of synthesis.  The "unity which the object makes necessary" does not depend on the (hidden) object, but on the activity of the mind in synthesis.
