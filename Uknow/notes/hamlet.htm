<P><table align=left bgcolor="#ffffff" cellpadding=10><tr><td><B><font size=+1>Hamlet:</font> <font color=red>To be, or not to be -- that is the question</font>:<br>
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer<br>
<font color=red>The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune<br>
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles</font>,<br>
And by opposing end them. To die -- to sleep --<br>
No more; and by a sleep to say we end<br>
The heartache, and <font color=red>the thousand natural shocks<br>
That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation<br>
Devoutly to be wish'd</font>. To die -- to sleep.<br>
<font color=red>To sleep -- perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub!</font><br>
For in that sleep of death <font color=red>what dreams may come<br>
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil</font>,<br>
Must give us pause. There's the respect<br>
That makes calamity of so long life.<br>
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,<br>
Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,<br>
The pangs of despis'd love, <font color=red>the law's delay,<br>
The insolence of office</font>, and the spurns<br>
That patient merit of th' unworthy takes,<br>
When he himself <font color=red>might his quietus make</font><br>
With a bare bodkin? Who would these fardels bear,<br>
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,<br>
But that the dread of something after death --<br>
<font color=red>The undiscover'd country</font>, from whose bourn<br>
<font color=red>No traveller returns</font> -- puzzles the will,<br>
And makes us rather bear those ills we have<br>
Than fly to others that we know not of?<br>
<font color=red>Thus conscience does make cowards of us all</font>,<br>
And thus the native hue of resolution<br>
Is sicklied o'er with <font color=red>the pale cast of thought</font>,<br>
And enterprises of great pith and moment<br>
With this regard their currents turn awry<br>
And lose the name of action. -- Soft you now!<br>
The fair Ophelia! -- Nymph, in thy orisons<br>
Be all my sins rememb'red.<p>

The soliloquy in <I>Hamlet</I>, wherein the Prince contemplates suicide, is one of the most profound reflections in all of literature.  It is also almost overwhelmed by the beauty of its language, contributing jewels of phraseology (as highlighted in red at left) to English discourse for the last four centuries.

<P><a href="../arthur.htm">Schopenhauer's</a> brief discussion strikes to the essence.  In German, we see a line even quoted in English, which Schopenhauer knew from his period of education in England:

<P><center><table width=220><tr><td>Der wesentliche Inhalt des weltber&uuml;hmten Monologs im &raquo;Hamlet&laquo; ist, wenn zusammengefa&szlig;t, dieser:  &nbsp;Unser Zustand ist ein so elender, da&szlig; g&auml;nzliches Nichtseyn ihm entschieden vorzuziehen w&auml;re.  Wenn nun der Selbstmord uns dieses wirklich darb&ouml;te, so da&szlig; die Alternative &raquo;Seyn order Nichtseyn&laquo; im vollen Sinn des Wortes vorl&auml;ge; dann w&auml;re er unbedingt zu erw&auml;hlen, als eine h&ouml;chst w&uuml;nschenswerthe Vollendung (<I>a consummation devoutly to be wish'd</I>).  Allein in uns ist etwas, das uns sagt, dem sei nicht so; es sei damit nicht aus, der Tod sei keine absolute Vernichtung. [<I>Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung, Band 1</I>, Philipp Reclam, Stuttgart, 1987, &sect;59, p.458]</td></tr></table></center>

<P>Schopenhauer's knowledge of English may have helped him avoid the pitfalls of writing philosophy in German that have bedeviled it ever since.  He certainly translates easily into great eloquence in English:<br clear=left>

<P><blockquote>The essential purport of the world-famous monologue in <I>Hamlet</I> is, in condensed form, that our state is so wretched that complete non-existence would be decidedly preferable to it.  Now if suicide actually offered us this, so that the alternative "to be or not to be" lay before us in the full sense of the words, it could be chosen unconditionally as a highly desirable termination ("a consummation devoutly to be wish'd" [Act III, Sc. I.]).  There is something in us, however, which tells us that this is not so, that this is not the end of things, that death is not an absolute annihilation. [&sect;59, <I>The World as Will and Representation</I>, Volume I, translated by E.F.J. Payne, 1958, Dover, 1966, p.324]</blockquote>

<P>Shakespeare's language is often incomprehensible to me.  Hamlet's soliloquy is not that bad, but some vocabulary items are either unfamiliar or used in archaic ways.  Webster's Collegiate Dictionary has the relevant definitions:  &nbsp;"Contumely" is "rude language or treatment arising from hautiness or contempt."  "Quietus" is "removal from activity, <I>esp</I>:  <font size=-1>DEATH</font>."  "Bodkin" is a "needle or sharp instrument," or a dagger.  "Fardels" are "burdens."  "Bourn" is "boundary" or "destintation."  "Conscience" we know, but in this case it means "consciousness" or "awareness."  "Pith" (as survives in "pithy") is used to mean "importance" or "significance."  Finally, "orisons" are prayers.  Hamlet wants Ophelia to remember him in her prayers.<br clear=right>
