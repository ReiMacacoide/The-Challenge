<P><blockquote><font size=+1>I think I see another motive in the French writers who in 1914 adopted the attitude of M. Romain Rolland -- the fear that they would fall into national partiality if they admitted that their nation was in the right.  It may be asserted that these writers would have warmly taken up the cause of France, if France had not been their own country.  Whereas Barr&egrave;s said, "I always maintain my country is right even if it is in the wrong," these strange friends of justice are not unwilling to say: "I always maintain my country is in the wrong, even if it is right."  There again we see that the frenzy of impartiality, like any other frenzy, leads to injustice.</font>

<P>Ted Lieu (D-CA), 12 December 2018, <img src="images/greek/unworthy.gif" align=middle>.  What planet is this guy from?  Democrats, of course, want to silence any opposition; but they are usually clever enough not to say so publicly.  But Ted Lieu lets us know about his lust for tyranny right out in the open.  Perhaps he hasn't gotten the memo with instructions about lying and dissimulation.  He really should think twice about his ability to honestly take the oath of office of a Congressman.  His heart is clearly not in the requirement to "perserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States"; but then the Democrats, and most Republicans, gave up on that a long time ago.  <a href="passion.htm#gibson"><img src="images/gibson.gif" align=middle width=37 border=0><img src="images/gibson.gif" align=middle width=37 border=0><img src="images/gibson.gif" align=middle width=37 border=0></a> <img src="images/thumb-d.gif" align=middle>

<P><font size=+1>“Slaves are generally expected to sing as well as to work,” observed ex-slave-turned-abolitionist Frederick Douglass. To the slave owners, singing slaves would drown out their own cruelty and oppression, clothe them in a coerced choir of decency. But it wasn’t enough that the slaves had to sing, they had to sing their oppressor’s feel-good songs that are summed up in the Porgy and Bess refrain of “I’ve got plenty of nothin’, and nothin’s plenty for me.”

<P>Yay, nothin’.

<P>Currently, the song being demanded is the national anthem during football games. But during a warm-up game on Aug. 10, despite President Trump’s previous condemnation, several Eagles players kneeled during the anthem or raised their fists — their way of singing their own song. For them, lyrics like “land of the free” don’t accurately represent the daily reality for people of color. They love their country [?!] but want that country to recognize the suffering that occurs when it isn’t living up to its constitutional promises.</font>

<P>"I don't believe in borders," a slogan on T-shirt worn by Keith Ellison (D-MN), <img src="images/greek/unworthy.gif" align=middle>, Deputy Chair of the Democratic National Committee, May 1, 2018, perhaps wishing to appeal to all in the common language of Americans and his constituents, that the United States should be like other nations, with no borders (?!); Ellison was accused of beating up his girlfriend, who had photographs and filed a police report, but the Minnesota Democratic Party ruled that there was "insufficient evidence" to act on the accusation, despite the Democrats recently claiming that 35 year old assault allegations, unheard until now, with no verifiable details, were sufficient evidence for them.  Now Ellison has been elected Attorney General of Minnesota, the same office <a href="valley/dilemmas.htm#clinton">Bill Clinton</a> had in Arkansas when he reportedly raped Juanita Broderick.

<P><font size=+1>The Trump phenomenon is pushback against what the late political scientist Samuel Huntington called the “deconstructionist” agenda, whose advocates seek to undermine America’s national identity through mass immigration and hostility to assimilation and opposition to the teaching of US history from a traditional, patriotic perspective, among other things.

<P>Huntington argues that until the late 20th century, these elites promoted national unity, as one would expect. “Then in the 1960s and 1970s,” he writes, “they began to promote measures consciously designed to weaken America’s cultural and creedal identity and to strengthen racial, ethnic, cultural, and other subnational identities. These efforts by a nation’s leaders to deconstruct the nation they governed were, quite possibly, without precedent in human history.”</font>

<hr>

<P><font size=+1>The United States has reached the extraordinary position where it has nurtured an ideology within itself, formulated and taught at <a href="public.htm">schools</a> and universities, that is not only hostile and disparaging to the majority race of the citizens ("white"), the majority religion (Christianity), and those economically successful minority groups (Jews, Koreans, people from India, etc.), <img src="images/ships/sos.gif" align=left><a href="rand.htm#modern"><img src="images/rat-29.gif" align=right border=0></a>but is equally and actively hostile and adverse to the principles of free speech, free association, free enterprise, and an open, participatory <a href="plato.htm#note">Republic</a> upon which the nation was built.

<P>Joseph Schumpeter thought that capitalism could be destroyed by many of the people who benefited the most from it.  But it is worse than that.  Elite culture not only despises capitalism, it celebrates impoverished dictatorships like <a href="newspain.htm#havana">Cuba</a>, or even, as with <a href="rand.htm#modern">Noam Chomsky</a> [<a href="passion.htm#gibson"><img src="images/gibson.gif" align=middle width=37 border=0><img src="images/gibson.gif" align=middle width=37 border=0><img src="images/gibson.gif" align=middle width=37 border=0><img src="images/gibson.gif" align=middle width=37 border=0></a>], Eastern Europe under Soviet rule.  These preferences were reflected in the complacency, or the active encouragement, for the <a href="presiden.htm#44">Obama Administration</a> to rule by administrative decree and to arbitrarily suspend, enforce, or rewrite existing law to its preferences.  <a href="rand.htm#modern"><img src="images/rat-01.gif" align=right border=0></a>The suppression of speech at American universities and the suspension of ordinary standards of due process and the rule of law demonstrate a preference for Stalinism that is contradicted by nothing otherwise expressed by elite intellectuals and "educators."

<P>It is difficult to imagine a previous country whose own <a href="ruling.htm">elites</a> turned against it, and against most of its citizens, so thoroughly.  <a href="presiden.htm"><img src="./ross/CA40/eagle.gif" align=left border=0></a>Roman history was often written by historians who preferred the Republic to the Empire (Livy or Tacitus) or who were alarmed at disasters that had occurred (Ammianus Marcellinus); but the Roman elite never conceived a hatred of themselves.  Indeed, the Roman state survived the disasters of the 4th and <a href="romania.htm#third">5th centuries</a> largely because of the confidence of the Romans in the value of their own civilization and their own religion.

<P>The same cannot be said for America, which has raised and holds a deadly viper to her own breast; and an unprecedented event may occur, where a great nation is precipitated into eclipse through the self-hatred of its own privileged, educated ruling class -- however baseless, absurd, or perverse that self-hatred actually was, and however clueless and repellent the folly of that elite.</font>

<P><font size=+1> The digital media company BuzzFeed faced backlash this week after posting a piece titled “37 Things White People Need To Stop Ruining In 2018.”

<P>BuzzFeed made online waves in December 2016 when one of its popular “listicle” pieces mocked the “plague” of “white people” populating the planet. Patrice Peck, the website’s multicultural beauty writer, added her own contribution to race-based click-bait on Thursday.

<P>According to the article, some of the things white people are responsible for ruining in 2017:

<P><blockquote>The United States of America<br>
The National Anthem<br>
The Oscars<br>
The Grammy Awards</blockquote>

<P>Ms. Peck’s piece generated nearly 730,000 views for BuzzFeed in less than 24 hours, but not without backlash.

<P>“Even if you subscribe to the asymmetric view of racism (ie, only some tribes can be racist, others can’t), it should not be hard to see why this sort of article is bad for America,” tweeted National Review Online contributor Dan McLaughlin.</font>

<P>The soon-to-be-former Democratic Senate leader issued a statement Friday that showed his contempt for anyone who voted for Mr. Trump. “I have personally been on the ballot in Nevada for 26 elections and I have never seen anything like the reaction to the election completed last Tuesday. The election of Donald Trump has emboldened the forces of hate and bigotry in America,” he said.

<P>“White nationalists, Vladimir Putin and ISIS are celebrating Donald Trump’s victory, while innocent, law-abiding Americans are wracked with fear -- especially African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Muslim Americans, LGBT Americans and Asian Americans. Watching white nationalists celebrate while innocent Americans cry tears of fear does not feel like America.”

<P>Crazy Harry went downhill from there...</font>

<P>"Harry Reid and the Horse He Rode In On," <I>The Wall Street Journal</I>, November 14, 2016, A16. Does Harry Reid really believe this stuff, or is it just another one of the lies he cherishes to ingratiate himself with the Left? He certainly doesn't seem to care that he smears and slanders "innocent, law-abiding Americans" all across the country.  <img src="images/revcom.jpg" align=right width=220>Verily, he has his reward.  But meanwhile, we should note that this is apparently an example of the "civility" about which the Democrats are always lecturing everyone else.  Presumably the anti-Trump riots that followed the 2016 election are also representative of Democrat "civility," complete with the burning of the American flag, signs that say, "America Was Never Great," and protesters marching behind Mexican flags -- to show, I guess, how much they believe in America. Cute.

<P>Of course, they don't believe in America; and now we get some professors who've decided that civility is actually part of "white supremacy."  Good manners deflect from the racism and oppression that dominates American society.  Practiced by whites, civility is condescension and the invalidation of rage about racism.  Practiced by minorities (except, of course, Jews or Asians), civility is submissive and defers to, rather than confronts, the unwillingness of whites to address racism, oppression, privilege, capitalism, etc. <img src="images/thumb-u.gif">

<P>Phrases deemed "microaggressions" by the University of California, "Tool: Recognizing Microaggressions and the Messages They Send" (a webpage now withdrawn); these are, of course, macroaggressions against, not just free speech, but any free political thought or expression -- there was a time when the Left thought it could get away with denying that "political correctness," i.e. political thought crimes, existed.

And their goals and loyalties have not changed.

<P><font size=+1>A few moments ago, the body was treated to a report from the senator from Iowa [Tom Harkin <a href="passion.htm#gibson"><img src="images/gibson.gif" align=middle width=37 border=0></a>] about his recent trip to Cuba.  Sounded like he had a wonderful trip visiting, what he described as, a real paradise.  He bragged about a number of things that he learned on his trip to Cuba that I'd like to address briefly.  He bragged about their health care system, medical school is free, doctors are free, clinics are free, their infant mortality rate may be even lower than ours.  I wonder if the senator, however, was informed, number one, that the infant mortality rate of Cuba is completely calculated on figures provided by the Cuban government.  And, by the way, totalitarian communist regimes don't have the best history of accurately reporting things.  I wonder if he was informed that before Castro, Cuba, by the way, was 13th in the whole world in infant mortality.  I wonder if the government officials who hosted him informed him that in Cuba there are instances reported, including by defectors, that if a child only lives a few hours after birth, they're not counted as a person who ever lived and therefore don't count against the mortality rate.</font>

<P><font size=+1>When the Chancellor of the University of California, Berkeley, Nicholas Dirks [<a href="passion.htm#gibson"><img src="images/gibson.gif" align=middle width=37 border=0></a>], commemorated the anniversary of the "Free Speech Movement" by saying that free speech, however important, must be balanced by "civility," he was, of course, saying that anyone who disagrees with leftist pieties better shut up.  When he said, "[W]e can only exercise our right to free speech insofar as we feel safe and respected in doing so," he neglected the fact that the people on his campus who feel the <I>least</I> "safe and respected" would be conservatives, Republicans, libertarians, Christians, and often also Jews.  The modern university, which has invented and relentlessly promoted and enforced "speech codes" that blatantly violate the First Amendment, which public schools, at least, are required to observe, obviously has no commitment whatsoever to free speech.  This is commensurate with the practice of leftist academics, whose scholarship is uniformly illiberal, intolerant, anti-capitalist, and anti-American, to silence and purge dissent from academic departments, and to sanction students who voice disagreement.  In other words, they are Stalinists.  Their idea of "diversity" and "civility" is when we hear from black and Hispanic communists as well as white communists (like Bettina Aptheker [<a href="passion.htm#gibson"><img src="images/gibson.gif" align=middle width=37 border=0><img src="images/gibson.gif" align=middle width=37 border=0><img src="images/gibson.gif" align=middle width=37 border=0><img src="images/gibson.gif" align=middle width=37 border=0></a>], who spoke at the Berkeley anniversary rally).

And as their behavior has served to discredit the value of the humanities and of a liberal education, they are faced with a generation of students who are aware that the debt they take on to go to college, and the insults and outrages that they must endure from leftist faculty and politically correct administrations, are not compensated for by the increasing lack of career opportunities, or even employment, for college graduates.  College is becoming a waste, and the Left has made it that way, even as they have already gone far to ruin all the rest of American <a href="public.htm">education</a>.</font>

<P><font size=+1>In the Fall of 2016, some professional football players in the National Football League (NFL) began refusing to stand for the <a href="history/anthems.htm#banner">National Anthem</a> at the beginning of games.  <img src="images/ships/sos.gif" align=left><a href="rand.htm#modern"><img src="images/rat-29.gif" align=right border=0></a>The explanation was that America was not deserving of their allegiance because <a href="police.htm">police</a> were murdering black people and because of other manifestations of <a href="racism.htm">racism</a> and "white supremacy" in the country -- despite the success, wealth, and privileges of the football players themselves, and despite the decisions of the Justice Department of their own belov&egrave;d and certifiably non-racist President <a href="presiden.htm#44">Obama</a> <I><B>not</B></I> to prosecute the police in key cases.

<P>This form of protest later spread to some college and even high school football players.  Of course, self-righteous and malicious ideology is what <img src="ross/ca40/flag-a.gif" align=right>is now taught in the schools and through the "progressive" politics that dominates universities and the media.  Anti-Americanism is the prevailing conviction among educated and radicalized elites, including the <a href="ruling.htm">Ruling Class</a> of government, bureaucracy, and their brain trusts.  <img src="ross/ca40/flag-c.gif" align=left>One is tempted to say that these people will not be happy until Americans, particularly white Americans and Christians, are being killed by the enemies of America and of civilization.  Islamic Terrorism promises the best opportunity for that, and the Obama Adminstration countenancing nuclear weapons in <a href="iran.htm#islamic">Iran</a> offers the most direct hope that Jews and Americans can be annihilated.

<P>America, the most successful nation in history, thus may also become the first to simply and abruptly commit suicide.  Indeed, the very definition of a "failed state" may be one that no longer commands the loyalty of its citizens, and that may be actively despised by them, however absurd, fallacious, incoherent, and dishonest their reasons.</font>

Here are some of the lines Ms. Streep delivered, followed by a short interpretation of what she really means:

<ul><li>“All of us in this room really belong to the most vilified segments in American society right now.” Translation: You may think of us as rich and powerful and good-looking, but we are really just victims who live in fear.

<P><li>“When the powerful use their position to bully others, we all lose.” Translation: In case you haven’t heard, Donald Trump is a lout.

<P><li>“We need the principled press to hold power to account, to call him on the carpet for every outrage.” Translation: The big problem today is that journalists aren’t willing to criticize Mr. Trump.

<P><li>“You’ll have nothing to watch but football and mixed martial arts, which are not the arts.” Translation: This is a warning for all you deplorable people clinging to guns and “Monday Night Football.”

<P><li>“Ryan Gosling, like all of the nicest people, is Canadian.” Translation: Under President Trump, the actor who just won a Golden Globe for “La La Land” lives in fear his home will be raided by the INS and he will be deported back to Ontario.</ul></font>

<P>William McGurn, "Meryl Streep Upstages Obama," <I>The Wall Street Journal</I>, January 10, 2017; McGurn does not emphasize the implications that (1) for the "most vilified," she's forgotten the "basket of deplorables" vilified by Hillary Clinton and her supporters (referenced by McGurn himself), (2) somehow the Obama Adminisration has <I>not</I> been bullying people, although many of its enforcement and regulatory agencies have indeed been doing so, (3) the Obama Administration and its frequently dictatorial actions <I>do not need</I> to held "to account" by the press, which <I>has not</I> been doing so, and (4) none of the "nicest people" seem to be actual Americans.

<P>There is a curious feature about American politics.  A substantial body of political opinion, evident in the media, academia, and popular culture, simply despises America -- its history, its principles, and its institutions -- and sees no value in the <a href="presiden.htm">Great Republic</a> unless it profoundly changes its character and assumes a form quite different from that of the past.  In 2008, examples of this attitude emerged in relation to the political campaign of Democratic Presidential Candidate <a href="presiden.htm#44">Barack Obama</a>.  None of them was more blunt and striking than the statement of the pastor, for 20 years, of Obama's own church.  In a sermon that was taped and available for sale at the church, the Reverend Jeremiah Wright could be seen simply saying, multiple times, "Not God bless America! God <I>damn</I> America!"  The aftermath of this becoming public was instructive in its own right.  Defenders of Wright protested that he didn't really mean it that way, that the quote was taken out of context (though anyone can watch the unedited sermon).  Or, of course, anyone complaining about Wright was simply a racist.

<P>Senator Obama first expressed concern, as though these kinds of statements from Wright were not familiar to him, and then, as Wright unapologetically defended himself in television appearances, Obama denounced him and resigned from his church.  However, <img src="images/obama5.jpg" align=right>it was undeniable that Obama's political career had begun associating with Wright and many others of similarly radical and anti-American stripe in the Chicago area.  Also, as in this case, it is characteristic of much Anti-Americanism in politics that, while it is freely expressed in private or partisan venues, it shuns the full light of public exposure and, when thus exposed, dissimulates, denies, or qualifies extreme statements.  When Senator Obama's wife, Michelle, made statements asserting that she had never before been proud of her country, reponses that were attempts at misdirection were also common.  Although Michelle was campaigning for Barack and making political statements, the claim was (from Barack himself) that she was above politics and properly immune from criticism.  Thus, in both controversies, the initial response was to avoid the substance of the matter and to claim that the story itself was dishonest or inappropriate.

<P>But why should Americans be anti-American?  The problem is ideological.  Mexicans are proud of Mexico just because it is Mexico -- regardless of crime, poverty, corruption, tyranny, etc.  Mexicans or Mexican-Americans wave Mexican flags at sporting events or in political demonstrations -- often booing teams representing the United States or the playing of <I>The Star Spangled Banner</I>.  Many Americans, however, are squeamish about even flying, let alone waving, the American flag -- patriotism, as Dr. Johnson said, and we are often told, is the last refuge of the scoundrel.  The difference between Mexico and the United States is that Mexican identity has a geographical, cultural, and historical foundation, while the United States was founded entirely on the basis of certain principles and ideals, with a history believed to embody those things.  The principles and ideals were the accomplishment of the Enlightenment, which especially in political terms, as recognized and advocated by Voltaire to his French readers, went back to <a href="locke.htm">John Locke</a> and the <a href="perifran.htm#restore">Glorious Revolution</a> of 1688 -- other Enlightenment tendencies, as with <a href="nature.htm">Jean Jacques Rouseau</a>, involved other ideals more in tune with later collectivism, statism, and totaliarianism.

In the 19th century the priniciples of Locke and the American Revolution would become <B>Classical Liberalism</B> -- for limited, secular government, private property, and the dignity and liberty of the individual.  Part of the problem, then, with the founding of America was the degree to which people would judge the country by its success, in their estimation, in living up to its ideals.  All the worse if popular political ideals were to <I>change</I>, while American institutions remained largely those of Classical Liberal form.  In a very significant way this is what happened.  Limited government and individualism lost favor by the beginning of the 20th century.  What appeared to be progressive ideology in the 20th century was largely for absolutist, collectivist, and statist government, following the ideology of people like <a href="hegel.htm">Hegel</a>, who influenced the 19th century development of European governments and politics.  This was bad enough, and the success of America certainly could not be favorably judged in terms of ideals alien to the spirit of her founding and development; but there would be something worse.  Even the <I>successes</I> of America could be judged as inadequate in terms of her own ideals, with the bitter irony of a kind of <I>Catch 22</I>.

<P>When it comes to the nature of ideals of the American Revolution, however, part of the problem is very old.  We find <a href="greek.htm#why">Greek philosophy</a> in origin and development associated with commercial culture and democracy.  The ultimate exemplar of this was the city of <a href="archon.htm">Athens</a>, which was wealthy from trade, the principal democracy in the Ancient World, and a wellspring of much of what we think of as Classical Greek civilization, from the theater, to history, architecture, art, and philosophy.  Nevertheless, the attitude of probably the greatest philosopher produced by Athens, <a href="plato.htm">Plato</a>, was hostile to almost all the cultural, economical, and political characteristics of the place.  He didn't like democracy, didn't like commercial culture, didn't like the foreign influences and residents who flowed through the city, and, expressed in a memorable addendum to the <I>Republic</I>, didn't even like the unfettered artistic expression that so immortalized the place -- an artistic expression of which his own vivid writings were a part.  Instead, Plato admired <a href="greek.htm#sparta">Sparta</a>, a place without literature, art, history, or philosophy, a place that would have vanished from human memory if Athenians had not begun writing about it.  In a very real sense, Anti-Americanism is part of this ancient conflict between Athens and Sparta; but of course there must be reasons for <I>that</I> conflict, Plato's reasons, in the first place.  Indeed.  Even now, it is often instructive to see Anti-American attitudes expressed through criticisms of Athens.

<P>Both Athens and America are critized over slavery -- as we see referenced by Barack Obama above as "this nation's original sin."  Criticism of Athens about slavery is a little silly, since no ancient state ever abolished slavery.  A condemnation of Athens would need to be of the form, "somehow, they should have known better."   America is more vulnerable, since the ideal of the Declaration of Independence that "all men are created equal" seems to be immediately contradicted by the continuation of slavery.  But we may well ask how, by introducing a contrary principle, slavery was <I>America's</I> sin.  Was slavery invented in America?  No.  Slavery had always existed everywhere.  The slave trade in West Africa had not even been started by Europeans, but by Arabs.  Instead of slaves being exported north across the Sahara, as they had been for centuries, Europeans bought them from the south and exported them across the Atlantic.

<tr><td><center>Be it known to you, that the Traffic in Slaves is a matter on which all Sects and Nations have agreed from the time of the sons of Adam, on whom be the Peace of God, up to this day -- and we are not aware of its being prohibited by the Laws of any Sect, and no one need ask this question [i.e. whether the trade in slaves be lawful], the same being manifest to both high and low and requires no more demonstration than the light of day.

Was slavery widely recognized as a wrong at the time of the American revolution?  No.  As we see in the statement of the Sultan of <a href="islam.htm#alawid">Morocco</a> in 1842, it had not been prohibited by the "Laws of any Sect."  Slavery was legal under Roman Law, Islamic Law, and, in general, in the Bible.  The idea that slavery was wrong <I>originated</I> in the Enlightenment ideology of the American Revolution itself, with about half of the American colonies abolishing slavery during that era, and the Constitution anticipated the abolition of the slave trade in 1808 -- a delay singled out, apparently as a reproach, by Barack Obama.  Support for slavery, of course, continued, not the least among African rulers who sold slaves, but also among slave owners who mostly had history, religion, custom, and law on their side.  Did America just never do anything about slavery as time went on?  No.  The controversy, argued with fury and recrimination, dominated the early years of American politics, resulting in a terrible Civil War in which more than 600,000 Americans died -- in contrast to the sum of about 400,000 African slaves that had been imported into the 13 American colonies in the first place.

<P><a name="text-2">In essence, then, how can slavery be the "original sin" of a country that not only <I>conceived</I> the ideal that slavery was wrong but then, at monumental cost in lives and fortune, got rid of it?  There is a serious perversity to such a charge, as though the evil of slavery had always been evident and recognized, or as though America (or the Constitution in particular) had invented or revived the institution, with stubborn complacency in the face of universal protest.  Nothing of the sort was the case.  And if it took America 20 years to abolish the slave trade and 74 years to abolish slavery, in the face of deep and violent opposition, how is it the fault of <I>America</I> for pressing against this opposition and finally, at great cost, overcoming it?  This makes no sense [<a href="#note-2">note</a>].  Similarly, when Southern opposition substituted Segregation for slavery, and little could be done about that politically until the 1950's, when those institutions were finally destroyed, why would that be America's fault?  Were racial and ethnic minorities just loved and protected everywhere else on earth?  Hardly.  Instead, the accusation of American <I>hypocrisy</I> in this regard looks motivated by a predisposition to condemn America on any pretext.  This is especially evident in regard to <I>Islam</I>, under which slavery and the slave trade were only abolished under European influence, pressure, and, very often, military force (i.e. "<a href="british.htm">Imperialism</a>").  Indeed, one often finds apologetics for slavery in Islam, that it was more humane and, well, hardly even slavery at all.  This wouldn't have passed muster with the <a href="islam.htm#mali">Kings of Mali</a>, who continually complained to their Islamic brethren north of the Sahara that slavers repeatedly captured the black Muslim inhabitants of Mali, despite prohibitions of enslaving Muslims in Islamic Law.

<P>The readiness to condemn America even for its accomplishments, as though the principles of the Declaration of Independence were immediately discredited just because they were new and faced resistance, is mainly ideological in origin.  The real problem does not come with the fulfillment of the ideals, but with what the ideals were in the first place.  A "somehow, they should have known better" view of American history that is fully ahistorical and anachronistic is not a genuine independent conviction but is simply used in the service of ideals that are alien and hostile to the original form of the American project.  As a rhetorical device, it condemns America both for things that it excuses in others and for failing to live up to ideals that are not respected anyway.  Part of this I have discussed elsewhere as the problem in Ethics of <a href="poly-1b.htm#relative">Moralistic Relativism</a>.  There I quote Paul Hollander in <I>The Survival of the Adversary Culture</I>:

<P><blockquote>Paul Craig Roberts characterizes the resulting attitudes [of Western and American intellectuals] as a "fusion of moral scepticism with the demand for moral perfection..."  He also points out that the high, moralistic demands on the part of intellectuals are almost invariably directed at their own society, rarely at those opposed to it.... In other words, the intellectuals discussed alternate between moral absolutism and moral relativism.  [<I>The Survival of the Adversary Culture</I>, Transaction Publishers, 1991, p. 156]</blockquote>

<P>It is certainly a painful irony when people who otherwise deny the objective or binding existence of moral principles, often with a nihilistic nod to <a href="nietzsch.htm">Friedrich Nietzsche</a>, nevertheless rise in furious moral indignation at the shortcomings of American history and government.  We may suspect, however, that this sort of incoherence and confusion, deliberately or not, masks something else.  In the background there may actually be a rather complete system of morality and ideology that is either deliberately concealed or is naively assumed to be so self-evident that, obvious to all, it need not be discussed.  It often seems to be a matter of both.  Thus, when Hitler invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, and Lillian Hellman said, "The Motherland has been attacked!" this was not because she believed in a Nietzschean transvaluation of all values, but because she was a Communist.  Yet much of the effort of the Communist Party in the United States in the 40's, 50's, and later was spent on denying that Communists <I>were</I> Communists, or that the Party was, in fact, a paid and controlled agent of the Soviet Union.  Thus, while in Marxist ideology <I>what</I> one is -- a class enemy -- counts for more than what one believes, the approach of the Party was to argue that Communists were being attacked simply for what they believed, not for what they were (Communists) and what they were doing (spying and subversion).  Thus, America could be faulted for violating its own individualistic principles, when those principles were not honored by the Communists anyway, and when the real complaint was criminal and treasonous activities, not speech (when people like Hellman, to confuse and dissimulate, never openly confessed what they believed anyway).

<P>This whole strategy continues in American politics <a href="rand.htm#modern">today</a>, where the "race, class, gender" development of Marxist ideology, as "post-modernism" or "critical theory," dominates American academics and intellectuals, where political correctness, ideological uniformity, and unconstitutional "speech codes" stifle or penalize dissent in education, and where any exposure, response, or complaint about any of this is immediately demonized as fascist, racist, or "classist" attacks on academic freedom or freedom of speech -- again from people who, in the appropriate private, protected, and friendly contexts, reject freedom of speech, and whose acolytes faithfully protest, intimidate, threaten, or physically assault opposition speech on campuses (free of sanction by compliant or sympathetic administrations).

<P>If we look at anti-Americanism from its modern Marxist perspective and at the opposition to Athens by someone like Plato, they end up with something very significant in common:  &nbsp;the desire on the part of people who are essentially thinkers, talkers, and plotters to control other people.  The essential problem of politics for Plato is just that the wrong people are in charge.  It should be, well, people like <I>Plato</I> -- the knowers, the wise, the philosophers.  The intellectuals, as the wise and the good, want to rule and they know that they will do a better job, regardless of the desires of the ignorant masses.  This is often <I>called</I> "democracy"; but we should not be surprised to learn that supposed democratic "reforms," like "campaign finance reform," only serve to protect established politicians and political parties, often criminally sanction grass roots efforts by ordinary citizens, who are bewildered or uninformed about the complexity of election laws, and are then aided and abetted by a press and media comfortably dominated by ideological friends.  The alternative media, like popular Conservative talk radio, are then attacked as illegitimate or unfair.  Rush Limbaugh, but not the Reverend Jeremiah Wright, gets called "the most dangerous man in America."

<P>Yet it is the likes of Wright who, by a constant pressure through education, opinion, and entertainment, still give the Soviet Union a chance to win the Cold War and turn America into a Soviet-style state.  Limbaugh, as a Conservative, merely fights to maintain traditional American cultural values and the traditional principles of American government.  As a Conservative, he is bound to be embarrassed when traditional cultural values are simply undermined by freedom (as with pornography and sexual mores), but his support of that freedom on the political side, as when he parts ways with Culture Warriors seeking censorship, puts him at odds, not with Gay Pride parades, but with people on the Left who, as noted, are aiming and active in attacking and suppressing free speech.

<P>The essence of anti-American politics may perhaps be found with demonstrators at the University of California at Berkeley not long ago.  They were literally <I>burning books</I> while carrying signs that said, "fight Fascist censorship."  It is a tribute to their own poor education that they could stage a book burning without realizing what this would look like, and what it would remind people of with any knowledge of history.  But they need not have worried.  No one put the images on the evening news, and one had to go to the alternative media to know that it had happened at all.

<P>In great measure, however, it is too late.  Anti-American principles have already infected government at all levels.  The New Deal was a mortal blow to the Constitution, and most Americans are not even aware why.  Most Republicans would not even agree with this -- ever since <a href="presiden.htm#34">Dwight Eisenhower</a> announced that his Administration would not challenge the basic changes effected by <a href="presiden.htm#32">Franklin Roosevelt</a>.  While the Goldwater wing of the party did seem ready to challenge them, the ultimate Goldwater President, <a href="presiden.htm#40">Ronald Reagan</a>, nevertheless did not, and continued to praise Roosevelt, as have subsequent Republican leaders like Newt Gingrich.  Republican Presidents after Reagan, i.e. the Bushes, have retreated further to the fatally compromising Eisenhower position.  By their own <a href="fiction.htm">definitions</a>, however, the Founders of this Nation, with the possible exception of Alexander Hamilton, would all regard the present, New Deal-modified Federal Government <B>as an active system of tyranny</B>.  In American political culture, the conventional wisdom is that only the most extreme lunatic fringe crackpot would assert any such thing; and Democrat leaders, like <a href="presiden.htm#42">Bill Clinton</a>, are pleased to claim the identity of the present form of government with all that has ever been good about the United States.  Thus, in a famous statement, Clinton asserted that, "[T]here's nothing patriotic about hating your government or pretending you can hate your government but love your country."

<P>But is hating a government that has burst all Constitutional boundaries and has extended its cold probing hand even into details about how much water a toilet can flush the same as being anti-American and hating the country?  It is hard to know if Clinton himself even believes this.  There is a fringe on the Right that has considered the country ruined ever since Abraham Lincoln, if not earlier (i.e. since the Constitution itself, which the Anti-Federalists suspected of all the evils that have in fact transpired).  Yet in one respect the choice is clear.  The Socialist temptation continues, and the overwhelming bulk of anti-American sentiment in academia and elsewhere is strongly fueled and founded in Marxism, as much or more so as even in the days of the Soviet Union.  Anti-Americanism is anti-Capitalism in all opinion that regards itself as "progressive."  That is why the New Deal continues to be so harmful, since it embodies the judgment that free markets fail and government knows best.  Instead, as the Founders knew well, government largess handed out for political favor is the essence of corruption.  This has now made the entire Federal Government one vast mechanism of <a href="rent.htm">rent seeking</a> and vote buying.  As "reforms" have attempted to make the government more democratic, all the classic evils of democracy, with demagogues promising free goods (such as the looming, and in fact continuing, socialization of medicine), again as well understood by the Founders, have emerged triumphant.  It may just be too late.  The Fabian anti-American Americans are getting their way on a broad front, hoping to transform the United States into France, if not another Soviet Union.

<P>The passive protests against the National Anthem referenced in the epigraph <a href="#anthem">above</a> began with a player named Colin Kaepernick.  After the presidential election of 2016, Kaepernick admitted that he hadn't even voted, asserting that voting didn't make any difference in the evils of the United States.  What alternative political system Kaepernick might prefer was revealed when, after the death of Fidel Castro, he began wearing shirts featuring Castro's image.  Asked about this, Kaepernick praised Castro and repeated the usual bogus lefist talking-points about Cuba's great accomplishments in education and health care.  He added that Cuba spends more on education than on prisons, while the United States does the opposite.  When reminded of Castro's crimes and of the health of Cuban prisons, full of political dissidents, some of whom President Obama expected to be freed as part of his deal to reopen diplomatic relations with Cuba, Kaepernick resorted to the old "moral equivalence" arguments familiar from the Cold War, that any crimes Castro may have commited are matched by those commited by America.  However, if the crimes of Castro and America really are equivalent, then why does this fellow love Castro and hate America?  Shouldn't he hate both?

<P>Of course, the millionaire athlete Kaepernick is a clueless idiot, but praise for Castro was common on the the Left, often just in terms that Castro resisted American "imperialism," or even with preposterous assertions of Castro's care for the poor and oppressed, for which, of course, he had no concern whatsoever, since he destroyed Cuba's previously successful economy and condemned Cubans to decades of poverty, not to mention to totalitarian dicatatorship in a police state.  Equally curious were tributes to Castro, as from Barack Obama himself, that tried to maintain a neutral tone which highlighted things like how Castro had "altered the course of individual lives" and which emphasized the "enormous impact of this singular figure on the people and world around him."  Unfortunately, the people formulating such tributes (Obama, in this case) don't seem to have noticed that they had crafted things that could have been said as well about Adolf Hitler, who probably had an "impact" and "altered the course of individual lives" of far more people than Castro did.  With both of them the unanswered question would be the <I>nature</I> of their influence and impact.

<P>Protests against the election of Donald Trump in 2016, whose campaign slogan was "Make America Great Again," often featured signs saying "America Was Never Great," along with actual burning of the American flag.  The protesters thus revealed that their complaint was not so much against Trump as it was against the United States of America.  The protesters, who often also became rioters, also carried signs that we previously saw at the "Occupy Wall Street" events, saying, "This is what democracy looks like."  However, in the election, American democracy had already spoken; and what a lot of the protesters and rioters seemed to think was that their actions could start a violent revolution to overthrow the government and install the kind of dictatorship that they favor, i.e. like their ideal, Fidel Castro.  Protests about police shootings had previously featured signs calling for violent revolution.  The press was careful not to allow viewers to see these kinds of things too clearly.

<P>Viewers, however, had gotten the message; and viewers had also gotten the message that, when Trump was smeared as a racist bigot, just for complaining about illegal aliens and terrorist infiltrators among Middle Eastern refugees and immigrants, the people engaging in the smear were themselves anti-American racist bigots, whose hatred for America, white people, Christians, and Jews was usually palpable.  The Hillary Clinton campaign featured cute signs saying "Love Trumps Hate," but it could not conceal the hatred among her supporters, especially in the academic brain trust at American universities, where free speech is now regarded as an evil, and students are taught that the United States is the worst regime that has ever existed.  Hampshire College in Massachusetts lowered its American flag to half-staff after the election.  The flag was then taking down and burned just before Veteran's Day.  The President of the College then decided not to fly the flag at all, provoking protests from actual veterans.  Meanwhile, nearby Amherst, Massachusetts, flies the United Nations flag rather than the American.  People know what this means.

<P>The Left and the leftist press and academics of America still don't seem to realize that their anti-Americanism and their own racial and religious bigotry helped Donald Trump get elected.  And by continuing to pour in on after the election, they stand a good chance of giving him a positive approval rating before he even becomes President -- someone who, like Hillary, had historical levels of <I>disapproval</I> before the election.  <img src="images/ships/us-1960.gif" align=right>But protesters who protest a <I>fair</I> election and then burn the flag hand him priceless favorable publicity.  People know what that means.  With any luck, 2016 will turn out to be the Armageddon of the anti-American Left, although the rot had already gone very deep indeed.  The National Football League has lost considerable viewership this year, and observers wonder how much of that is due to the League's tolerance of players who disrespect the National Anthem and the Flag.

<P>The speech that the Reverend Jeremiah Wright gave on September 17, 2009, at an event in honor of the Socialist magazine <I>Monthly Review</I>, continues his anti-American rants but also reveals something else.  He complained that the "corporate media" did not allow the truth about socialism, Marxism, racism, imperialism, etc. to be uttered to the American people and especially did not allow people "of color" to speak these truths.

<P>This is a characteristic conceit of the Left, that they are somehow silenced and that the urgent message they have for the American people cannot get out.  Such a conceit, however, is disingenuous, dishonest, or deeply and grotesquely self-deceived.  The truth is that they <I>want</I> to conceal their message as much as possible.  Whenever the Reverend Wright's rants (or the views of any other influential Leftist) become public, there is uproar and outrage at the depths of their folly and viciousness -- while they complain that they are being "attacked" with revelations that are somehow distorted or "out of context."  Far from desiring the exposure of the whole context, people like him want their views directed at a target audience and otherwise kept secret.  Marxists prefer moving in their friendly circles and really don't like being outed to the public.  Even when they display their naked views and loyalties on signs at public demonstrations, the media, even Fox News, conveniently never focuses on such signs long enough that they can be read easily (even in freeze-frame), let alone pauses to discuss what they are and what they mean.

<P>The strategy of concealment and deception was explicitly formulated by the Marxist Saul Alinsky, and it is generally and cleverly followed by the Left.  Wright knows this himself, since one of his statements that became public was that Barack Obama was only saying what he needed to, i.e. moderate, vague, and unthreatening promises, to get elected.  After Obama was elected, Wright said that he was not being invited to the White House only because "them Jews" were keeping him out -- presumably so that Obama would not lose support in the Jewish community, which foolishly and self-destructively continues to vote for Democrats -- with Anti-Semites like Wright in the near background.

<P>The irony and absurdity of Wright's accusation against the "corporate media" is that the so-called "main stream" media is almost wholly in league with the Alinsky strategy of the Left.  It is mainly on the dreaded Fox News that Wright and other radicals in the Obama Administration or from Obama's background are regularly exposed to public view.  They obviously don't like that.  This constantly puts the lie to their conceit of not being <I>able</I> to get out their message.

<P>When 2008 Republican Presidential nominee John McCain appeared on "The View," a morning television talk show on the ABC network, and said that he wanted judges to rule according to the "original intent" of the Constitution, host Whoopi Goldberg asked if this meant that she would be returned to slavery.  McCain hardly knew how to answer such a strange question -- stated as though the Constitution had created or required the existence of slavery, or the slavery specifically of Africans.  Indeed, slavery was already enough of an embarrassment to many participants in the writing of the Constitution that the word "slavery" was deliberately kept out of it.  One wonders what the basis of Golberg's remark was.

<P>Actually, what Goldberg had in mind may have been the "three fifths" rule for determining apportionment in the House of Representatives, as mentioned in Ariticle I Section 2.  After mentioning free persons, those "bound to Service for a Term," and Indians (who were excluded from the Census), the text says that "three fifths of all other Persons" will be counted.  Thus, "all other Persons" would be those neither free, nor bound to service for a term, nor Indians.  That only leaves the "non-free" slaves.  This rule is often cited as meaning that the Constitution regarded slaves as not fully human, providing more evidence of racism and evil on the part of America.  Unfortunately, it only provides evidence of the ignorance and anti-American animus of those promoting such an interpretation.

<P>One need only ask how <I>slave owners</I> wanted slaves counted for apportionment.  Although slave owners would certainly have been the ones to regard slaves as less than human, it was in their self-interest to have slaves counted as <I>full persons</I>, since this would then give Slave States greater representation and power in Congress.  Anyone <I>opposed</I> to slavery didn't want slaves counted for apportionment <I>at all</I>, since that would reduce the power of the Slave States.  The three fifths rule was a compromise.  It had nothing to do with whether slaves were fully human.  It simply reflected the political fight over the power of the Slave States.  The result was, as the North grew faster than the South, the House of Representatives was soon dominated by the Free States.  <img src="history/no-reb.gif" align=right>The South focused its political efforts on retaining an equal number of States in the Senate.  One of the causes of the Civil War was that, beginning with California in 1850, only Free States were admitted to the Union.  The balance of Slave and Free States was upset in the Senate, and there was no prospect that any new Slave State would ever be admitted to the Union.  The South knew it had a losing cause and, when Lincoln was elected in 1860, chose Secession.  Anyone who does not acknowledge this political dynamic is simply looking for a pretext to hate America.
