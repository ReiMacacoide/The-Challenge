This wonderful list is entirely from <I>The Princeton Companion to Classical Japanese Literature</I>, by Earl Miner, Hiroko Odagiri, and Robert E. Morrell [Princeton University Press, 1985, 1988], p. 463-467.

<P>Stretching from the time of Emperor Charles the Bald to President Andrew Johnson, this list, as few things can, provides a vivid testament to the continuity of custom and tradition in Japan.  The offices, originally symbolic of the passing of real power from the Emperors to the Fujiwaras, later become largely symbolic themselves, as power passes to Cloistered Emperors, Sh&ocirc;guns, and even Regents of Sh&ocirc;guns.

<P>Starting in 1158 individuals from branch lines of the Fujiwara appear in the offices.  These are the "five regent families" (the <I>gosekke</I> -- Konoe, Kuj&ocirc;, Nij&ocirc;, Takasukasa, & Ichij&ocirc;), and they alone would soon be considered for these offices, with the sole exceptions of the two Toyotomis.  Also, until very recently, wives for the Emperors were supposed to come from these families.

<P>Down to 1267, the genealogy of the Fujiwara, with the beginning of the regent families, can be examined in a <a href="javascript:popup('history/fujiwara.gif','fujiwara','resizable,scrollbars,width=621,height=1799')" onMouseover="window.status='Click for popup genealogy of the Fujiwara';return true" onMouseout="window.status='';return true">popup diagram</a>.  The genealogy is from the <I>Kodansha Encyclopedia of Japan</I>, Volume 2 [Kodansha Ltd., 1983, p.369].  This is at present just the stetch of a diagram.  The women near the top of the diagram are those who became consorts of Emperors.  More women can be added and the Emperors identified to fill out the genealogy.  Other Fujiwara, besides those who became Regents or Chancellors, can also be added.

<P>The first Fujiwara is <B>Kamatari</B>.  In 644, under the Empress K&ocirc;gyoku (642-645), he helped purge members of the Soga clan.  With the Soga gone, Kamatari became the supporter of the new Emperor K&ocirc;toku (645-654), ushering in the Yamato Period (645-711).  K&ocirc;toku granted Kamatari and his descendants the name Fujiwara.  The family divides into a number of branches, the most important of which is the Hokke or Northern house.  <B>Yoshifusa</B> (d.872) ushers in the heyday of the Fujiwara.  With a sister and daughter married to Emperors, when his young grandson comes to the throne as the Emperor Seiwa, Yoshifusa inaugurates a Regency.  Seiwa reigns but Yoshifusa rules.  His nephew and adopted son <B>Mototsune</B> (d.891) refines and extends this system.  First, an Emperor, like Seiwa himself, can be persuaded to retire, with a Regency then continuing for a new minor Emperor, in this case Y&ocirc;zei (858).  Or, as subsequently with Y&ocirc;zei, the Regency may be ended but the arrangement of rule continued through a new office, that of <I>Kampaku</I> or Chancellor (in 880 or 882).  This becomes the mechanism of Fujiwara power:  &nbsp;(1) Fujiwara mothers for the Emperors, (2) early retirement for Emperors, (3) Regencies for minor Emperors, and (4) the Chancellorship for Emperors between their minority and their retirement.  This system continued to dominate the government until the Cloistered Emperors began excerising authority in their own right (with Shirakawa in 1086) and then, finally, when the war between the Taira and the Minamoto was ended at Dan-no-Ura in 1185 -- then the samurai Sh&ocirc;guns (or the H&ocirc;j&ocirc; Regents) began exercising the real power of the government.  Nevertheless, the institution of Regents, Chancellors, and even Cloistered Emperors continued down to the Meiji Restoration.  Only Fujiwaras (and then the five regent families) were qualified for Imperial marriages, Regencies, or, except for the Toyotomis, the Chancellorship.

<P>The maintenance of titular authority while real power is exercised elsewhere becomes a striking characteristic of Japanese government.  The assumption by <B>Hideyoshi</B> of the office of Chancellor represented a moment when a traditional office might have been revived with real authority; but then <B>Ieyasu</B> was content to return the Ky&ocirc;to government to its traditions, while taking for himself the Sh&ocirc;gunate -- from which he quickly retired (1605) but continued to direct events, like the reduction of Osaka Castle in 1615.  The Fujiwara regent families thus played out the roles created by Yoshifusa and Mototsune all the way to 1867.

<P>The difference between titular and real power, however, continues as a serious question into the 20th century.  Were Emperors like Meiji and Hirohito constitutional figureheads or active and involved rulers?  The forms of Japanese government served to enclose and obscure the authority they may actually have been exercising.  This is of interest with Meiji but becomes a most important question with Hirohito, whose involvement and responsibility for the policies and actions of the Japanese government leading up and into World War II are a matter now hotly disputed.  The post-war representation was that he had always been, consciously, a British style Monarch who merely reigned.  Only on the rarest of occasions would he even express an opinion, and he only directed specific policy in one case, when he ordered the War to be ended.  Subsequently, charges have been made that the Emperor actually masterminded all of Japanese aggression, directing policy and commanding actions as much as Hitler or Mussolini.  This seemed rather wild at the time, but subsequent research has seemed to show that Hirohito, at least, was rather more involved in things than the official story allowed.  Be that as it may, the very uncertainty of it is of a piece with Japanese history -- even as we see exactly six hundred years (1267-1867) of relatively powerless Fujiwaras in the table.

Theoretically, there might be a continuous succession from the Edo Chancellors to modern Prime Ministers; but it took a little while to get the forms of a modern Government organized, so there is not formally a modern cabinet with a "President of Ministers" until 1885.  However, when the proclamation of the resumption of Imperial Rule was made on 4 January 1868, and the Shogunate and Regency abolished, the office of <I>S&ocirc;sai</I>, "President," was created and conferred on an Imperial Prince, <B>Arisugawa Taruhito</B> (1835-1895).  This clearly made Prince Taruhito the formal Head of Government, and it was not simply a figurehead position, since the Prince subsequently became commander of the armies that subdued Tokugawa resistance and occupied Edo.  However, the office of <I>S&ocirc;sai</I> was then abolished in May 1869.  This left the question Who was the Head of Government?  The recent <I>Emperor of Japan, Meiji and His World, 1952-1912</I> by Donald Keene [Columbia University Press, 2002] leaves this matter rather obscure.  Keene says that in August 1869 <B>Sanj&ocirc; Sanetomi</B> (1837-1891) was appointed "minister of the right" (<I>Udaijin</I>) one of the old Imperial Court offices copied from the Chinese Court [p.183].  However, one of the next references to Sanj&ocirc; is as "prime minister," in the context that he was replaced, because of illness, by <B>Iwakura Tomomi</B> (1825-1883) [p.234].  This seems to have only been a temporary replacement, because Sanj&ocirc; is again referred to as Prime Minister in the discussion of subsequent events.  Iwakura is himself called "minister of the right" [pp.254 & 267].  In the index, Sanj&ocirc; is identified as "vice president" [p.911] and Iwakura as "assistant president" [p.894].  Keene does not give or discuss the Japanese versions of these titles, or when Sanj&ocirc; would have been elevated to Prime Minister.  I have been able to resolve some of these interesting ambiguities.  The <I>Historical and Geographical Dictionary of Japan</I>, by E. Papinot [1910, Charles E. Tuttle, 1972] says that Sanj&ocirc; became Prime Minister, <I>Daj&ocirc;-daijin</I> (again a Court title), in 1874 [p.539 -- <I>Udaijin</I> in 1868].  Iwakura's stint is not mentioned; and this still leaves a gap between 1869-1874 for who would have been <I>Daj&ocirc;-daijin</I> or, in some other sense, Head of Government.  Perhaps Sanj&ocirc;, as Minister of the Right, was informally Head of Government, accounting for Keene's vagueness.  What we certainly see happening in this, with the abandonment of the Shogunate and the Fujiwara office of Chancellor, <I>Kampaku</I>, is the reemergence of the offices of the Yamato Court.  The Prime Ministership, <I>Daj&ocirc;-daijin</I>, is supposed to have been created in 671 or 702.  Thus, the lapse of the Fujiwara and Bakufu regimes leaves the Yamato offices as the default form of government.  Then, in 1885, the government was reorganized, Court offices like <I>Daj&ocirc;-daijin</I>, "minister of the right," or "minister of the left" were abolished, and <B>It&ocirc; Hirobumi</B> (1841-1909) became Prime Minister, <I>S&ocirc;ri-daijin</I>, in an explicitly European style Cabinet (<I>Naikaku</I>).  Thus, the precedent of European government now replaces that of the Yamato and Heian Court.<br clear=left>

Since Japan adopts a Constitution patterned after that of Prussia, the Prime Minister is not necessarily accountable to the Diet, but to the Emperor.  What ended up happening is that, rather than choosing the other ministers, the Prime Ministers themselves were often those acceptable to the Army and the Navy, who scorned civilian authority and exercised vetoes on the rest of the Government.  This ultimately had disastrous consequences, promoting militarism, military rule, and then wars of aggression.

<P>Pre-World War II Prime Ministers who were assassinated are in boldface.  Also highlighted are Prince <B>Konoe</B>, a familiar Fujiwara name, who committed suicide after the War rather than be tried as a war criminal, and General <B>T&ocirc;j&ocirc;</B>, who attempted suicide for the same reason but failed, was convicted, and was hung.

<P>T&ocirc;j&ocirc;, it might be noted, resigned in 1944 after the loss of the Battle of the Philippine Sea, after which the Japanese realized that nothing could hold off the Allied advance on Japan.

<P><img src="history/japan-3.gif"> 

<P>Unlike Germany, where the Nazi government simply ceased to exist and the Allies divided and directly ruled Germany, a formal Japanese Government never ceased to exist during the Allied Occupation.  A new Constitution was written, and Prime Minister <B>Katayama</B> was the first to govern under it.  Now the Emperor had no theoretical power at all, not even as much as the Queen of England.  He was no longer the Sovereign, and Japan was no longer an Empire.  The Prime Minister was responsible to the Diet.

<P>The Emperor is now just the "Symbol of the State," which is a status otherwise unheard of in the history of government.  Although the reactionaries who want the Emperor restored as Sovereign have frightening purposes, it is also true that Japan will never return to being a "normal" country until its Consitution is commensurable with traditional norms of government, and Japan again has a proper Army and Navy, another goal of the reactionaries that would be reasonable if their purposes, again, could pass scrutiny.

<P>Most Post-War Prime Ministers (since 1955) have been from the Liberal- Democratic Party, which people like to say is neither liberal nor democratic.  Instead, Diet seats have tended to become hereditary, and Japanese government often seems to be little more than a system of influence-peddling.  Consequently, corruption and bribery scandals are commonplace.  Such a scandal led to the downfall of the familiar 1980's Prime Minister <B>Nakasone</B>, who got to preside over Japan's greatest period of world economic domination.

<P>The 1990's were less good for Japan, whose prosperity turned out to be a little too much of a speculative bubble, with a great deal of capital based on inflated real estate values and fraudulent loans.  Since almost nobody really believes in <I>laissez-faire</I> anymore, it always takes a long time for the economy to shake stuff like that off.

<P>This list was originally based on the list of Japanese Prime Ministers at the Mizuho Financial Group site, which is now gone, and on the list in <I>The Making of Modern Japan</I> by Marius B. Jansen [Belknap Press, Harvard University Press, 2000], updated from news sources and Wikipedia.<br clear=left>
