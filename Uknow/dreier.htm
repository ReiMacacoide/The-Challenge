<P>re:  Opinion, The State:  "A Multiracial and Multilingual Progressivism Is Born in L.A.," Peter Dreier and Robert Gottlieb, Sunday, March 11, 2001

<P>Dear Sirs:

<P>What planet have Peter Dreier and Robert Gottlieb been living on?  Can't they recognize that their "progressivism" is the same old "command" economics that condemned Russia and Eastern Europe, not to mention post-colonial Africa, to decades of poverty and misery?  

<P>If their ideal is the "progressive<font color=red>"</font> movement["] in New York City, they might [take a moment to] notice that people live in the subways there, while others who are well off [indeed] live in spacious, rent-controlled apartments for a few hundred dollars a month.  Indeed, there is more abandoned housing in New York City than <font color=red>there are</font> homeless people who might fill it.  Heaven help us if housing in Los Angeles ends up conducted, even more than it is now, on the basis of such [vicious and] <font color=red>a</font> discredited ideology.


<P>Yours truly,<br>
Kelley L. Ross<br>
