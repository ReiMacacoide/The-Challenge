<P><ol>
<li> The <I>Wall Street Journal</I> is read by the people who run the country.<p>

<li> The <I>Washington Post</I> is read by people who think they run the country.<p>

<li> The <I>New York Times</I> is read by people who think they should run the country.<p>

<li> <I>USA Today</I> is read by people who think they ought to run the country but don't really understand the <I>Washington Post</I>. They do, however, like their statistics shown in pie chart format.<p>

<li> The <I>Los Angeles Times</I> is read by people who wouldn't mind running the country, if they could spare the time, and if they didn't have to leave LA to do it.<p>

<li> The <I>Boston Globe</I> is read by people whose parents used to run the country and they did a far superior job of it, thank you very much.<p>

<li> The <I>New York Daily News</I> is read by people who aren't too sure who's running the country, and don't really care as long as they can get a seat on the train.<p>

<li> The <I>New York Post</I> is read by people who don't care who's running the country, as long as they do something really scandalous, preferably while intoxicated.<p>

<li> The <I>San Francisco Chronicle</I> is read by people who aren't sure there is a country or that anyone is running it; but whoever it is, they oppose all that they stand for. There are occasional exceptions if the leaders are handicapped minority feminist atheist dwarfs, who also happen to be illegal aliens from ANY country or galaxy as long as they are Democrats.<p>

<li> The <I>Miami Herald</I> is read by people who are running another country but need the baseball scores.<p>

<li> The <I>National Enquirer</I> is read by people trapped in line at the grocery store.

<P>This was passed along to me by my wife'e late friend, Gary Curtis.  God knows where it came from originally.

<P>In response to this page, Gary O'Brien sent this British version of the list, whose provenance he identifies as from a December 1987 episode of the BBC series "Yes, Prime Minister."  Link below.

<P>Unfortunately, I understand that the <I>Sun</I> has now discontinued its traditional topless "Page Three" girls.  I don't know what the world is coming to.
