<P>Dear Sirs:

<P><font color="#0000ff">In "Bring Back the Smoke-Filled Room" (op-ed, Nov 2),</font> Jason Riley says that after Trump vs. Clinton “party insiders” should get more say in picking a nominee for their parties.  However, according to <font color="#0000ff">Mr.</font> Riley’s own account, Hillary Clinton was the choice of the Democrat “party insiders.”  Indeed, she has been for years, since before <font color="#0000ff">the emergence of Barack</font> Obama.  Donald Trump represents a revolt against such insiders in the Republican Party, as <font color="#0000ff">Bernie Sanders did in</font> the Democrat<font color="#0000ff">ic Party</font>.  The last two Republican presidential candidates, John McCain and Mitt Romney, were themselves ”insider” candidates.  How did that work out?  Does Riley really want more Clintons, McCains, and Romneys?  I hope not.  I sure don’t.
