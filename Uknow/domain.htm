<P>The table below summarizes the theory of the <B>polynomic</B> or <a href="poly-1.htm"><B>polynomological system of value</B></a>, where most domains of value are subsumed under larger domains.  Each encompassing domain is ontologically stronger and deeper, but each nested domain is logically stronger and has a more definable content.  Note that every form of value is a <B>good</B>, even though "good and bad" are specifically listed for non-moral ethical goods.  There are also non-moral uses for "right and wrong," as one says of a mathematical mistake, "That's not <B>right</B>," or asks the mechanic, "What's <B>wrong</B> with my car?"  The diagram below the table gives the elements of the system in terms of the underlying metaphysical theory explained <a href="system.htm">elsewhere</a>.

<P><a name="text">While <img src="images/greek/right.gif" align=middle>, <I>orthos</I>, "right, correct, straight" is perfectly reasonable in this context, <a href="system.htm"><img src="images/onto-06.gif" border=0 align=right></a>my feeling is that it would be more natural in Greek to say <img src="images/greek/dikaios.gif" align=middle>, <I>dikaios</I>, "just."  The Latin counterpart of <img src="images/greek/right.gif" align=middle> is <I>rectus</I>, also meaning "right" and "straight," a word that is in fact the cognate of "right" in English and <I>Recht</I> in German.  The neuter form of <I>rectus</I>, however, now has a very different meaning, deriving from <I>rectum intestinum</I>, i.e. the "straight intestine" or rectum.  But the same word also turns up in mathematics, as the <I>latus rectum</I>, one of the dimensions of a <a href="separat.htm#kepler"><img src="images/greek/kepler-4.gif" align=left border=0>conic section</a> -- namely, the chord through the focus at <I>right angles</I> to the major axis ("d" at left is the semi-latus rectum -- and, yes, <I>latus</I> is of the neuter gender, <I>latus, lateris</I> -- hence <I>lateralis</I>, "lateral").

<P>On the other hand, <img src="images/greek/dikaios.gif" align=middle> would correspond to <I>justus</I> in Latin and is derived from <img src="images/greek/dike.gif" align=middle>, <I>dike</I>, "custom, right, judgment, trial, justice," etc., as <I>justus</I> derives from <I>jus</I> (genitive <I>juris</I>), "right, law" -- hence <I>justitia</I>, "justice."  In English, "justice" tends to be reserved for legal and judicial contexts, while in Greek <img src="images/greek/dikaios.gif" align=middle> retains a more general moral overtone, as Plato uses it in the problem of the <a href="plato.htm"><I>Republic</I></a>.  In the New Testament, <img src="images/greek/dikaiosu.gif" align=middle>, <I>dikaios&yacute;n&ecirc;</I>, which might well mean "justice" in Greek, nevertheless can be translated "righteousness" [2 Corinthians 6:21].

<P><a name="text-1">The ambiguity of <I>jus</I> itself is of interest, since with a general meaning of "correct action," it can mean both a "right" in the <a href="rights.htm"><img src="images/square-s.gif" border=0 align=right>modern sense</a> and a "duty," which is something <I>imposed</I> by a right, not identitical to it.  A similar ambiguity turns up in French, where <I>droit</I> can mean either a "right" (as in <I>les droits d'homme</I>, "the Rights of Man") or a "duty" (as in <I>Dieu et mon droit</I>, "God and my duty," the motto on the arms of the Kings and Queens of England). That could be confusing; but both "right" and <I>droit</I> originally just meant "straight" (<I>rectus</I>, <img src="images/greek/right.gif" align=middle>) and so implied any kind of moral or legal correctness.  Indeed, "doing the right thing" generally means behaving in a morally correct or dutiful way, regardless of what rights may or may not be involved. [<a href="#note-1">note</a>]

<P>Similarly, the Greek term <img src="images/greek/kind.gif" align=middle>, <I>gennaios</I>, "noble, kind," also seems less than paradigmatic.  Latin <I>benevolentia</I>, "good will, kindness" is the right word, but its Greek counterpart, <img src="images/greek/euboulos.gif" align=middle>, <I>euboulos</I>, although corresponding in etymological sense, nevertheless tends to mean "well-advised" or "prudent" rather than benevolent or kind.  This goes back to  <img src="images/greek/boule.gif" align=middle>, <I>boul&ecirc;</I>, which does indeed mean "will," but also "counsel," or even "Council," i.e. part of the government of <a href="archon.htm">Athens</a>. Its cognate in Latin, the verb <I>volo</I>, "to will," does not have the extra meanings as in Greek.  Thus, I have gone for the Greek word that is actually the cognate of "kin," the root of "kind":  &nbsp;<img src="images/greek/genos.gif" align=middle>, <I>genos</I>, "race, <img src="images/legs-g.gif" align=left>stock, family" (Latin <I>genus</I>).  See Alcestis use <img src="images/greek/kind.gif" align=middle> in <a href="gender.htm#alcestis"><I>Alcestis</I></a> by Euripides.

<P><a name="beauty"><hr>

<P>An intriguing contrast of usage in Greek is between the noun <img src="images/greek/beauty0.gif" align=middle>, "beauty," and the adjective <img src="images/greek/beauty.gif" align=middle> (feminine <img src="images/greek/beau-fem.gif" align=middle>, neuter <img src="images/greek/kalon.gif" align=middle>), "beautiful."  While the meaning of the former is generally confined to physical beauty, the latter has a range of meaning that extends well beyond the aesthetic into the moral, so that it can mean "good, virtue, admirable, fair, noble, fine," etc.  We also get <img src="images/greek/the-neut.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/pankalon.gif" align=middle>, "the all beautiful, good, noble, or excellent."  Socrates uses this when he asked Euthyphro what is the "excellent aim," <img src="images/greek/the-neut.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/pankalon.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/ergon.gif" align=middle> ["all noble work"], that the gods have, using us as their servants [<a href="euthyph.htm#fourteen"><I>Euthyphro</I> 13e</a>].  Euthyphro answers <img src="images/greek/polla.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/kai.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/kalos-n.gif" align=middle>, "indeed many fine things," using the neuter plural adjective.  We see the interesting adjective, <img src="images/greek/neck-3.gif" align=middle> ("very beautiful"), used for Aphrodite <a href="bliss.htm#note-5">here</a>.  This is based on "beauty," <img src="images/greek/beauty0.gif" align=middle>, with the addition of <img src="images/greek/peri-a.gif" align=middle>, "around," and is applied to specifically physical beauty, in this case just to Aphrodites neck, <img src="images/greek/neck-1.gif" align=middle>.  Also see <img src="images/greek/kalliope.gif" align=middle>, the epic <a href="greek.htm#justify">Muse</a> with the "Beautiful Face [<img src="images/greek/eye-1.gif" align=middle>]." 

<P>We also get the interesting and common expression in Greek, <img src="images/greek/beaungod.gif" align=middle>, "beautiful and good," a contraction of <img src="images/greek/beauty-g.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/kai.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/good.gif" align=middle>.  The "beautiful" in this is generally seen as having its moral connotation, which gives us the sense that the "noble" or "excellent" part of <img src="images/greek/beauty.gif" align=middle> goes beyond the mere goodness of <img src="images/greek/good.gif" align=middle>.  On the other hand, common homoerotic graffiti in Athens was of the form "[so-and-so] <img src="images/greek/beauty.gif" align=middle>," i.e. "so-and-so is beautiful."  This is understood to involve an emphasis on physical beauty, which is generally what was regarded as attractive about young men.  We do not, of course, get the corresponding graffito about girls, "[so-and-so] <img src="images/greek/beau-fem.gif" align=middle>," since the beauty of respectable women was not admired in public, young girls had no romantic relationships with men, and the implication that they did, or exposed themselves to admiration, would be an insult to the honor of them and their family.  It might result in blood, as seen in the Mediterranean and Islamic world today.  In the <I>Euthyphro</I> we also find Socrates using the adverb, <img src="images/greek/kaloos.gif" align=middle>, to mean "correctly" or "truly" [<a href="euthyph.htm#examine">9e</a>].<br clear=left>

<P><a name="chinese">A correspondent has suggested that <img src="images/hiero/good3.gif" align=middle> would be a better term for "good" than <img src="images/hiero/good.gif" align=middle>, especially since it occurs in an expression like <img src="images/hiero/good3.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/evil.gif" align=middle>, "good and evil" -- with the <img src="images/hiero/evil.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/person.gif" align=middle>, "evil man" (Japanese <I>akunin</I>), as the sort of person hopelessly condemned to the Buddhist <a href="elements.htm#note-6">Hells</a>, who can be saved by the compassionate Vow of the <a href="six.htm#jodo">Buddha Amit&acirc;bha</a>.  However, that may be just the point.  The semantic range of <img src="images/hiero/good3.gif" align=middle>, as we see it in <a href="confuciu.htm#kill">Confucius</a>, seems to be narrower and specifically to have more the sense of <I>moral good</I> than <img src="images/hiero/good.gif" align=middle>.  The latter has a broader and more general application, including things like a "good complexion," a "beautiful face," or, as a verb, <img src="images/hiero/good4.gif" align=middle> (in the 4th tone), "fond of women."  That is just the point of hortative value, with its non-moral range, and <img src="images/hiero/good.gif" align=middle> is therefore more appropriate.  <img src="images/hiero/good3.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/evil.gif" align=middle> is itself an interesting expression, where "good and evil" in English tends to have a moral reference.  Just as "evil" in English is a moral adjective (although standing in for "bad" as a noun), <img src="images/hiero/evil.gif" align=middle> itself, with a basic meaning of "evil, wicked, wrong, foul," is mostly applicable to what is wicked and vicious, not just bad.  As a verb, <img src="images/hiero/em-6.gif" align=middle> means to "dislike," "<a href="emotion.htm">hate</a>," or "loathe," or to be "hateful, abominable."  In turn, <img src="images/hiero/good3.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/mind.gif" align=middle>, "good heart," "good mind," or "benevolent," is then the equivalent of <img src="images/ren2.gif" align=middle>, "benevolent."  [cf. <I>Mathews' Chinese-English Dictionary</I>, Harvard University Press, 1972, characters #2062, #4809, & #5657.]

<P>The correspondent also suggested that <img src="images/hiero/upright.gif" align=middle>, "upright," was a better term than <img src="images/ren2.gif" align=middle><img src="images/yi2.gif" align=middle>, especially since the latter, as <I>jingi</I> in Japanese, is used for the code of the gangster Yakuza.  However, <img src="images/ren2.gif" align=middle> and <img src="images/yi2.gif" align=middle> are the Confucian terminology for benevolence and righteousness, which also figure in the <a href="taote.htm#38">Taoist</a> critique of Confucianism; and the binome <img src="images/ren2.gif" align=middle><img src="images/yi2.gif" align=middle> is used by <a href="confuci.htm#note-3">Mencius</a>, who certainly never heard of the Yakuza (or, for that matter, of <a href="sangoku.htm#japan">Japan</a>).  <img src="images/hiero/upright.gif" align=middle> is, however, a noteworthy character, especially since it duplicates the non-moral and geometrical, as well as the moral, meanings of <img src="images/greek/right.gif" align=middle> and <I>rectus</I> as "straight" and "rectangular" (i.e. "right angles").

Thus, the assignment in some treatments does not seem consistent.  Under <a href="moral-2.htm">Judicial Moralism</a>, <img src="images/greek/hasan.gif" align=middle> is used for "good," while in <a href="poly-1.htm">The Polynomic Theory</a>, it is used for "beauty."  It can mean both, just as <img src="images/greek/salih.gif" align=middle> can mean both "righteous" and "good."  More restricted is <img src="images/greek/jayyid.gif" align=middle> for "good" and <img src="images/greek/jamil.gif" align=middle> for "beautiful."  Another case is the term <img src="images/greek/malih.gif" align=middle>, which originally would mean "salty" but also "beautiful" and "handsome."  In Levantine Arabic, meaning the Syrian, Lebanese, and Palestinian dialects, the meaning of this drifted into meaning "good" in terms of food (<a href="hawaii.htm#pronounce">Hawaiian</a> <I>'ono</I> as opposed to <I>maika'i</I>) or "tasty," pronounced <B>ml&icirc;h.</B> or <B>mn&icirc;h.</B>.  The accompanying table illustrates these different constructions.  Other words for "good" occur in other dialects of Arabic -- <img src="images/greek/tayyib.gif" align=middle>, is "good, pleasant, delicious, kindly," etc. in Classical Arabic, "good" in Libyan Arabic, and is used as the equivalent of "OK" in Lebanon.  See the use of <img src="images/greek/salah.gif" align=middle>, <I>s.al&acirc;h.</I>, "goodness, righteousness, piety, godliness," in the name of the heroic <a href="islam.htm#ayyub"><B>Saladin</B></a>.<br clear=left>

<P>The effect of this, of course, is that good intentions do not necessarily lead to right action or to good consequences -- "the path to Hell is paved with good intentions".  The protection of personal rights may, nevertheless, violate property rights, or the other way around.  Beautiful things, or good art, may be, in some sense, bad things (e.g. <I>The Triumph of the Will</I>).  And, as a saying goes in Japanese, "even a fish head can be an object of veneration," i.e. some ugly, nasty object may be sacred.

As each negative value (wrong, bad, etc.) turns over to a positive, the value to its right turns over.

<P>The force of moral obligation is characterized with terms (mostly) borrowed from grammar.  "<B>Imperative</B>" goes back to <a href="moral-1.htm#note-1">Kant</a> (the "categorical imperative") and is a term used for the mood of verbs in many languages that expresses a command (Latin <I>impero</I>, to order).  That an imperative is different from the indicative verbal mood mirrors <a href="key.htm#ought">Hume's</a> observation that propositions with "ought" do not logically follow from propositions with "is."

<P>"<B>Optative</B>" was introduced by <a href="nelson.htm">Leonard Nelson</a> as part of the <a href="friesian.htm">Friesian</a> critique (which began with Schiller) of Kant's <a href="poly-1b.htm#moralism">moralism</a> (cf. Nelson, <I>System of Ethics</I>, Yale, 1956, p.165).  The term "optative" was borrowed from Greek grammar, where it "takes its name from its chief independent use, that of expressing a wish"

(Chase & Phillips, <I>A New Introduction to Greek</I>, 3rd edition, Harvard, 1965, p.82).  The word itself, of course, is Latin, from <I>opto</I>, "choose, select" and its participle <I>optatus</I>, "wished for, desired, welcome."  We also get other derivates like <I>optimum</I>, "best," and "optimism," meaning, well, you know.

<P>The original Friesian division of ethics into moral and non-moral value has here been extended.  A wish is often for something outside of one's control, which sounds more like independent objects that can occur in aesthetic value.  Nelson's category has thus been subdivided into "optative" and "<B>hortative</B>."  The latter is borrowed from Greek grammar again, where it signifies the subjunctive mood that is used "to express a request or a proposal" (Chase & Phillips, p.103).  It is therefore an <I>exhortation</I>, with the sense and root of both words from Latin <I>hortor</I>, "to exhort, incite, encourage."  Exhortations as "horatives" will be for some good end that is nevertheless not a duty.  It shares features with aesthetic value, including aesthetic variety.

<P>We find Socrates talking about exhorting people towards virtue [<a href="apology.htm#wealth"><I>Apology</I></a>, 29d-30a].  He uses the verb <img src="images/greek/exhort-1.gif" align=middle>, derived from the verb <img src="images/greek/keleuo.gif" align=middle>.  Both can mean "to order" or just "to urge, exhort."  However, the emphasis with the latter would seem to be on the former meaning, while the emphasis with the former, which sports a prefix and uses the middle voice (called a "deponent" verb, where the middle or passive voice has an active meaning), is softened into the latter meaning.  Socrates, who only asked people questions, was not in the business of ordering anyone to do anything.

<P>A particularly evocative hortative in Greek is found in the last words of the Emperor <a href="romania.htm#paleo2">Constantine XI Dragases</a>.  Fighting at the Fifth Military Gate of Constantinople on May 29, 1453, the Emperor faced the <a href="turkia.htm#mehmet">Turks</a> who were then breaking through the Walls.  With the Fall of the City imminent, Constantine reportedly threw off his regalia and exclaimed, <img src="images/greek/letsgo-1.gif" align=middle>, <img src="images/greek/men-v.gif" align=middle>, <img src="images/greek/letsgo-2.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/letsgo-3.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/letsgo-4.gif" align=middle>, "Let's go, men, against these barbarians!" [Greek Text, Laonikos Chalkokondyles, <I>The Histories</I>, Volume II, translated by Anthony Kaldellis, Dumbarton Oaks Medieval Library, Harvard University Press, 2014, p.192].  Rushing into the melee, he was killed.  His remains were never identified with certainty.  <I>&Iacute;&ocirc;men</I>, <img src="images/greek/letsgo-1.gif" align=middle>, "let's go," first personal plural "go" is a subjunctive used as a hortative.

<P>Moral obligation has also been subdivided, between "imperative" and "<B>jussive</B>."  This term I have now borrowed from Arabic grammar (it also occurs in Hebrew), where it is a mood of the <a href="system.htm#note-1">imperfect</a> verb, usually formed by dropping the final vowel (which in Hebrew is already lost and will be lost in spoken modern Arabic).  It is often used to express an imperative (Latin <I>iubeo, iubere, iussi, iussum</I>, "to order, command") and indeed the proper Arabic imperative is constructed from it (Ziadeh & Winder, <I>An Introduction to Modern Arabic</I>, Princeton, 1957, pp.123-124, 129).  Indeed, in Latin itself, the "jussive" is the use of the subjunctive as an imperative, as the hortative is a use of the Greek subjunctive (Frederic M. Wheelock, <I>Latin</I>, Barnes & Noble, 1956, 1966, p.133).  For the polynomic system, a "jussive" is used for duties involving property, contract, and other legal issues in which there is an element of convention, custom, and perhaps jurisdictional variation.  Laws concerning <a href="nature.htm#force"><I>mala prohibita</I></a> or "<a href="moral-2.htm#strict">strict liability</a>" may have no moral force at all.

<P>Finally, "<B>pietative</B>" is a neologism, on analogy with the other terms.  This is from Latin <I>pio</I>, "to seek to appease by an offering, to propitiate," <I>pius</I>, "dutiful, pious," and <I>pietas</I>, "dutifulness, piety."  Religious duties, of course, concern <I>ritual</I>, that certain activities must be done in a certain way, or that there are specifically religious events, marriage, ordination, burial, etc., for which the proper ritual procedures are prescribed,

or that certain precautions or remedies be observed in relation to specifically religious subjects, such as pollution.  What is distinctive about these religious obligations is that they are entirely vacated by a change or loss of religion.  The atheist may have rituals, but they will tend to fall into the category of an obsessive-compulsive disorder -- which may be how the atheist views religion.<br clear=left>

<P>The idea of the different moods of obligation is that they are part of the larger picture of the <a href="system.htm">system</a> of metaphysical modes of necessity (including analytic, <I>a priore</I>, etc. necessity).  Also, all the modes of necessity are <I>identical</I> in force in an absolute sense, even as their force seems attenuated as we move from imperatives to pietatives.

<P>This is reflected in the <a href="system.htm#diagram"><img src="images/onto-14.gif" align=left border=0>diagram</a> at left, which is constructed on analogy with the magnetic substates in <a href="quanta.htm">quantum mechanics</a>.  The "angular momentum vector," which is a constant length, represents the full and absolute force of necessity, or obligation.  Angular momentum on the <I>z</I> axis, however, varies from the full value to zero.  Thus, the <I>z</I> axis represents what we see in the phenomenal world, while the full vector is necessity among Kantian things-in-themselves.  The pietative Holy, whose rational content is indeterminate and apparently arbitrary in the phenomenal world, not only is as necessary among things-in-themselves as imperative obligation or analytic necessity, but the vector is at a perfect right angle to the <I>z</I> axis, i.e. its force is wholly outside the phenomenal world.  This is therefore conformable to the religious sense that all obligation is ultimately a function of religious obligation.  Rationally, the prohibition of pork in Judaism and Islam is a very different matter from the prohibition of murder, but in terms of the valence of religious obligation they may be identical.  Thus, the Ten Commandments contain no internal distinctions to distinguish the prohibition of "graven images" from those of theft, adultery, or murder.  Here, the former is a pietative, while the latter are jussives and imperatives.  This goes back to the dispute in Mediaeval <a href="hist-1.htm#islam">philosophy</a> been Ibn S&icirc;na (Avicenna) and Al-Ghaz&acirc;l&icirc;.  The former held that the prohibition of wine in Islamic law was <a href="wisdom.htm"><I>prudential</I></a> (a hortative) and therefore could be overruled by a <I>physician</I> for medical purposes.  Al-Ghaz&acirc;l&icirc;, however, held that the prohibition was absolute, an imperative, and could not be abrogated for any reason.  Prudential or not, obeying the prohibition was a sign of obedience to God.  The idea that God would command things that were not dictated by reason was contrary to the spirit of Greek philosophy and the Hellenizing Islamic <I>fal&acirc;sifah</I>, <img src="images/greek/falasifa.gif" align=middle>; but Al-Ghaz&acirc;l&icirc; was not in that tradition.<br clear=left>

<P>One might ask, why colored legs?  Part of it is by accident, with the background that the modes of value here are color coded, as a vivid device to distinguish their variety.  The accident is the arrival of an e-mail advertisement for tights, from the late British vendor "MyTights," which just happened to display the rainbow of colors, including all the colors used for the modes of value, with some extras.  So I have added Chinese characters for the values and virtues, matched with the colors.  The non-accidental part is the desire to do something <a href="moral-2.htm">politically incorrect</a>, using the vivid display of women's legs for othewise serious axiological business.  The variety of colors is <I>already</I> an aesthetic statement, and the legs simply amplify this, perhaps even in an erotic direction.  The politically incorrectness would go back to <a href="feminism.htm">feminist</a> objections to using women's bodies to sell things.  Of course, the origin of this ad was to sell clothing for women's bodies, which is rather hard to do without giving some indication of the bodies, or parts of them, that the clothing is for.  On the other hand, feminists might regard colored tights as insufficiently serious, morally and politically, for the enlightened to be involved in.  This would be consistent with the political <a href="poly-1b.htm#text-3">anhedonia and anaesthesia</a> of much of feminism.  But then, this site is not in the business of selling clothes, or anything.  It does "sell" ideas, but not for money.  Perhaps that is enough to motivate objections that women's legs do not belong here.  Good.  Political incorrectness achieved, with the addition of a Greek <img src="images/greek/beau-fem.gif" align=middle>.

<P>The Latin value terms involve some interesting features.  <I>Rectus</I> especially has semantic connections that go beyond a simple geometric meaning of "straight."  The root here seems to be the verb <I>rego</I> (<I>regere, rexi, rectum</I>), "to guide, direct."  The most immediate derivative of this looks like <I>rex, regis</I>, "king," whose ancient <a href="cognates.htm">Indo-European</a> echo we even see in Sanskrit <img src="images/greek/raja.gif" align=middle>, <I>r&acirc;ja</I>.  The <I>moral</I> and <I>political</I> meanings of <I>rectus</I> are thus deeply embedded in the word, from which we get <I>regno</I>, "to rule," <I>regnum</I>, "royal power" or the "realm" of a king, <I>regio</I>, a "realm, region, country," etc., and <I>rector</I>, "ruler, governor, director, guide."  <I>Rectus</I> as "straight" or "ruled" or "guided" can have purely geometrical application, as can <I>regio</I>, but the meanings of morally "right, correct, proper, straightforward, honest," etc., are not just metaphorical -- <I>rex</I> alone reveals an ancient dimension of action and practice.

<P>Since <I>jus</I> can mean both "right" and "law," an interesting contrast may be with <I>lex</I>, which begins by meaning "a set form of words," from <I>lego</I>, "to ordain, appoint, delegate authority," and so meaning a "contract," leading to "a law, a bill, as proposed to the people," and then "a law as passed, a statute."  Thus, the distinction between <I>jus</I> and <I>lex</I> looks like it will accommodate that between <a href="nature.htm">natural law</a> and <a href="key.htm#positive">positive law</a>.  <I>Jus</I> is what is right regardless of what the actual <I>leges</I> are.  Similarly, <I>jus</I> determines the nature of <I>justicia</I>, "justice," which can be used to judge the laws themselves, and of <I>justus</I>, that which is "just" as a person or thing.  <img src="images/rights.gif" align=right>A righteous person will be <I>justificus</I>, "justified," which was the name of an intriguing television series about an unconventional (i.e. he shoots a lot of suspects) U.S. Marshal (Raylan Givens, played by the marvelous Timothy Olyphant, 2010-2015).

<P>In those terms, the ambiguity of <I>jus</I> between "rights" and "duties" comes out with a tendency to the latter.  The righteous or justified person does not have that character for demanding his "rights," but because he observes his duty and recognizes the rights of others.  Demanding one's "rights" may leave the impression only of self-regard, self-centeredness, and <a href="greed.htm">selfishness</a> -- espeically when we begin to suspect that many of the "rights" are the bogus entitlements of the <a href="quiz.htm#bogus">Welfare State</a>.  This undercuts the fundamental meaning of morality, which is to recognize the dignity and autonomy, i.e. the rights, of others.  Of course, if we recognize the rights of others, this certainly means that they have such rights, which serve to protect their own persons and interests.  They have the right, indeed, to enforce their rights, but it is a matter of self-interest -- reminding us that self-interest is not in itself improper or wrongful, which is part of the confusion over the views and arguments of <a href="bees.htm">Bernard Mandeville</a>.
