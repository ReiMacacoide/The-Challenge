<H3><I>Editorial Note</I></H3>

<P>Versions of this page have been circulating for some time.  Some philosophical schools, as well as religions, have worked their way in.  Some people don't think that religion, or at least their religion, is a matter for humor.  If these characterizations offend anyone, please be informed that they are supposed to offend <I>everyone</I>.  If you think you might be offended, pleasure return to the Philosophy of Religion <a href="religion.htm">index</a>.  Death threats are unwarranted.  See religion taken seriously <a href="numinos.htm">here</a> and <a href="newotto.htm">here</a> -- more so than in most universities, or even in the religion departments thereof.  Other entries have been suggested, but, really, there are limits.
