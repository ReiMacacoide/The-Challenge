<P>re:  "Judge Denies AIDS Patient's Request for Marijuana," A18, Wednesday, March 10, 1999

<P>Dear Sirs:

<P>The decision of U.S. District Judge George H. King to refuse to allow Peter McWilliams the medical use of marijuana is <font color="#ff0000">[despicable and]</font> unconscionable.  <font color="#ff0000">[Indeed, it is rather like a crime against humanity.]</font>

<P>King says he cannot allow, to a possibly dying man, "what amounts to a license to violate federal law."  Yet the judge himself should know two things:  (1) Necessity, as in life and death, is a Common Law reason to violate many kinds of laws; and (2) the drug laws he is talking about blatantly and egregiously violate the Tenth Amendment [of the United States Constitution], not to mention every person's natural right to use <font color="#ff0000">[effective]</font> medicine.

<P>A judge who cannot find some reason or pretext to grant the compassionate use of marijuana to Mr. McWilliams is therefore a man without conscience or honesty:  Not just a bad judge, but a bad man<font color="#ff0000">[, and an evil man.  It is an outrage and a disgrace that we have to put up with this kind of thing, and with these kinds of "good German" judges, in America, just to try and enable sick people to use effective medicine]</font>.

<P>Yours truly,<br>
