<H1 ALIGN="center">Statistics on Inflation, 1946-1997</H1>

<p><center><img src="images/key-2.gif"></center>

<P>These statistics are taken from various sources.  The basic inflation numbers may be found on the Internet at the <a href="http://www.census.gov/">Census Bureau</a>, the <a href="http://stats.bls.gov/">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, or the <a href="http://www.dallasfed.org/">Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas</a>.  The inflation <B>rate</B> is given after the inflation level, which itself is a percentage of the average of the years 1982-1984 (1982-84=100%).  Double figures are artifacts of changes in statistical methods or of contradictory information.  Note that 1967 prices are about a third of 82/84 prices and 1995 prices about 3/2 of those.
