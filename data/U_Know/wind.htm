The <B>Beaufort Scale</B> has become the standard method of judging wind force.  It is not the oldest, since rating the strength of wind by number and/or assigning names to the ratings had been done for some time.  In 1806 Francis Beaufort (later Admiral and Sir) wrote out a numerical scale in his log.  This was evidently copied from a British Admiralty pamphlet.  Beaufort, however, refined and specified the scale, and in 1838 it was officially adopted by the Admiralty.  In 1906 a report further refined the scale with corresponding wind speeds and descriptions of effects on land.  Beaufort himself had specified the sailing conditions that went with each rating, as seen in the chart at right.

<P>Separate wind scales for tornadoes and hurricanes did not come until the 1970's. The <B>Fujita (or Fujita-Pearson) Scale</B> for tornadoes was proposed in 1971 by T. Theodore Fujita and Allen Pearson.  Soon thereafter, the <B>Saffir-Simpson Scale</B> for hurricanes was formulated by Herbert Saffir and Robert Simpson.  Thus, the movie <I>Twister</I> was anachronistic when it had Helen Hunt's father warn, in 1965, that they might have an F5 tornado headed toward them.  The scale had not been invented yet.

<P>There has been some recent revision of some of these systems.  I have not yet updated the presentation here.

<P><img src="images/greek/winds-n.gif" align=right>The complete Beaufort Scale has thirteen divisions, as shown above (starting with <a href="century.htm">zero</a>).  Beaufort grouped these into 5 categories of winds, or finely divided using five "breezes," four "gales," and four other designations.

</table>

<a name="text-1">Breezes and gales both use the same simple scale of adjectives in the table at left.  It always seemed a little odd to me that the designations jumped directly from "breezes" to "gales."  One might expect an intermediate category, like simple "winds."  Indeed, Beaufort himself grouped "strong breeze" and "moderate gale" as "strong winds" [<a href="#note">note</a>].  The Fujita and Saffir-Simpson scales are almost entirely subdivisions of hurricane force winds.  Only the F0 tornado merely has gale force winds.  The complete table below gives wind speeds, the appearance of objects affected by the wind (as described in 1906), the kinds of damage to be expected from tornadoes and hurricanes, and other details, like barometric pressure, for hurricanes.  Gale force winds mean that a "tropical depression" becomes a "tropical storm," which is then given a name by the appropriate authorities.  Warning flags for water craft are also given.  At the left of the table, the Beaufort, Fujita, and Saffir-Simpson Scales are given B, F, and S numbers, respectively.  Note that severe hurricanes are often attended with tornadoes as well.  Hurricanes in the Western Pacific are called "Typhoons," and those in the Indian Ocean, "Cyclones."  Tornadoes used to often be called "Cyclones" also.  Modern terminology is that <I>all</I> low pressures systems, which includes hurricanes, tornadoes, and less severe phenomena, are "cyclones."

<P>In 1927, a German captain, Petersen, provided "State-of-Sea" descriptions for each wind force.  These are given at right.  The term "white horses" is not familiar to me, at least from American usage.  This seems to mean simply "whitecaps."<br clear=right><P><table border bgcolor="#ffffff">

<P>My introduction to meteorology came with the <I>Life Science Library</I> book <I>Weather</I>, by Philip D. Thompson, Robert O'Brien, and "the Editors of LIFE" [Time Incorported, 1965], which I acquired, about the time it was published, when I was in Junior High School.  Some of the descriptions here are still drawn from that volume.  I did have an actual meterology class at the <a href="./ross/">University of New Mexico</a> in 1968, but I got less out of it than I might have and failed to hold on to any class materials.  Now, however, complete background to all of this can be found at <a href="http://www.weather.com/">The Weather Channel</a> website.  The following descriptions have been taken from that source, from <I>Everything Weather</I>, The Weather Channel's CD-ROM, and from other sources, web and print, that I have lost track of.  A detailed history of the Beaufort Scale is now to be found in <I>Defining the Wind, The Beaufort Scale, and How a 19th-Century Admiral Turned Science into Poetry</I> by Scott Huler [Three Rivers Press, New York, 2004].  I was unaware of the sailing condition descriptions, or indeed of the history of the Scale, until finding this book.  The Petersen State-of-Sea descriptions can be found at the British  <a href="http://www.met-office.gov.uk/education/secondary/students/beaufortscale.html">Met(erological) Office</a>.

It may be silly, but it bugs me that the Beaufort terminology should jump directly from a "breeze" to a "gale."  As I use the words, "wind" can refer to all movement of air, but the very same word also denotes something that is rather more than a "breeze" but still less than a "gale."  I don't think of a breeze as much of a wind at all, while a gale is something quite strong and unusual, at least on land, or apart from a winter storm.  A breeze is pleasant, and will not cause any inconvenience or rearrange any objects, except the lightest.  A real wind, however, many be annoying, render some activities unpleasant, and will move some things around, even if only leaves, that will require attention.  But then a gale:  &nbsp;no outside activities will be pleasant, and the wind can cause some damage.

<P>I remedy this with the additions at left.  Here we simply would have three "breezes," three "winds," and three "gales."  This is how it might be done in Chinese, where many things, like rank, are divided into "high," <img src="images/greek/high.gif" align=middle>, "middle" <img src="images/greek/middle.gif" align=middle>, and "low" <img src="images/greek/low.gif" align=middle>, degrees.  I expect that the exclusive use of "breeze" and "gale," without using "wind" for specific forces, might be to avoid ambiguity.  In the traditional Beaufort Scale "wind" is not used with two meanings, the general and the specific.  That is quite reasonable.  My proposal then, would certainly not be for any usage where ambiguity might cause some inconvenience or danger.  The table simply represents my intuition about ordinary usage and meaning, that a breeze is not quite a wind, while a gale is much more than just a wind.<br clear=left>

<a name="clouds"><center><img src="images/key.gif"></center>

<H1 align=center>Clouds</H1>

<p><center><img src="images/key.gif"></center>

<P><img src="images/greek/winds-e.gif" align=right>Clouds are the mountains of the sky.  They can, indeed, be taller than any mountains of the earth, reaching up to 40,000 feet or, rarely, even to 60,000 feet, far beyond Everest.  On the other hand, they exist on a vastly different time scale.  The tallest clouds can develop and disappear in less than a day, while earthly mountains grow and erode over millions of years.  In Los Angeles, there is usually not much to be seen in the way of interesting clouds.  Much of the weather is simply clear, and in the spring and summer a marine layer of fog and stratus clouds moves in.  Occasionally in the summer, thunderheads develop over the San Gabriel mountains and the storms may, though sometimes not for several years, move over the Los Angeles basin.  Winter storms off the Pacific, usually lasting no more than a day or two, are responsible for most of the average rainfall of 15 inches.  <a href="./ross/">Growing up</a> in Los Angeles, I didn't feel like I saw much in the way of cloud variety until I lived in New Mexico, Lebanon, Hawaii, and Texas.  New Mexico was especially noteworthy for the colors that would play on the clouds:  &nbsp;The setting sun could fill the same sky with yellow, pink, orange, and cherry red on different clouds.  In <a href="hawaii.htm">Hawaii</a>, where clouds would build up over the windward mountains daily in the rainy season, one striking memory is of the full moon shining on the towering, isolated thunderheads.  There was, however, limited thunder from those clouds, which would drop some rain in the valleys and foothills and then disperse, often not even getting Waikiki wet.  More violent weather came with the occasional winter storm (a "kona" storm, since the wind may blow from leeward, against the trade winds), or with the rare hurricane.

<P>Clouds are classified by form and by altitude.

<P>The basic forms, with symbols, are <img src="images/cloud-cu.gif" alt="cumulus" align=middle> ("heaped up," in Latin), <img src="images/cloud-st.gif" alt="stratus" align=middle> ("spread out," the <a href="feminism.htm#note-0">neuter</a> form of which is <B>stratum</B>, used for extensive layers of similar rock in geology), and <img src="images/cloud-ci.gif" alt="cirrus" align=middle> <a name="text">("lock" or "curl" of hair)</a>.  Cumulus clouds tend to form from rising air, from 6,000 feet on up, and so are classified as "vertically developing" clouds.  Stratus clouds, below 8,000 feet, may be rather like an elevated <B>fog</B> bank; or, altenatively, fog can be thought of as a stratus cloud at ground level.  While cumulus clouds mean that air has risen to an elevation where the temperature is at the <a href="#dew">dew point</a>, so that the water condenses, with stratus clouds the temperature of the air itself may have fallen to the dew point.  Cirrus clouds are ice crystals at high altitude, from 18,000 to 40,000 feet; their whispy structure comes from scattering by the wind.

<P>Besides stratus, low level clouds can include <img src="images/cloud-ns.gif" alt="nimbostratus" align=middle> (between 3,000 and 10,000 feet), from which rain falls (<B>nimbus</B> simply means "cloud," or "raincloud") and <img src="images/cloud-sc.gif" alt="stratocumulus" align=middle> (below 8,000 feet), where cumulus clouds stretch out in a solid layer, showing a lot more structure than stratus clouds, whose outlines can be very indistinct.

<P>At high altitudes (18,000 to 40,000), cirrus clouds can form a fairly solid layer, becoming <img src="images/cloud-cs.gif" alt="cirrostratus" align=middle>, or they can take on a lumpy structure, with grains or ripples (a "mackerel sky"), suggestive of cumulus clouds, becoming <img src="images/cloud-cc.gif" alt="cirrocumulus" align=middle>.

<P>At middle altitudes, from 6,000 to 18,000 feet, too low to <img src="images/cloud-cb.gif" alt="cumulonimbus" align=right border=2>freeze into cirrus but higher than ordinary stratus, are <img src="images/cloud-as.gif" alt="altostratus" align=middle> (above 15,000 feet) and <img src="images/cloud-ac.gif" alt="altocumulus" align=middle>.  The "alto-" element is from Latin "altus," which originally meant "grown" but came also to mean "high," as it is used in these names.  Altocumulus can be part of the development of cumulus and cumulonimbus clouds.

<P>The highest -- all the way up to 60,000 feet -- most spectacular, and most violent clouds result when the air, rising to form cumulus clouds, continues to rise, <img src="images/cloud-th.gif" alt="thunderstorm" align=left border=2>
drawing moisture to high altitudes and generating extreme conditions.  This makes a <B>cumulonimbus</B> cloud.  The swelling top spreads out into a characteristic anvil shape, which then may be blown away by high level winds.  Because of freezing air at those altitudes, the streaming clouds from the anvil will often take a cirrus form.  Freezing air can also cause <B>hail</B> to form, as ice crystals begin to fall and then are lifted back up again and again to grow larger and larger.  When the hail finally falls, descriptions of its size are borrowed from the produce counter and from sports:  &nbsp;Small hail is described as "pea" sized, whence we move up to "grape" sized, "ping-pong ball" sized,  "golf ball" sized, "baseball" sized, and, most devastating of all, "grapefruit" sized.  Baseball and grapefruit sized hail can break any window, ruin a car, flatten a field of crops, or even kill somebody.  The movement of wind, water, and ice up and down the column of clouds also generates differentials in electrical charge, which are then discharged as <B>lightning</B>.  Isolated thunderstorms, generated by summer heating, may pass over with a minimum of damage.  Spring cold fronts, however, pushing still cold air from the north under warm moist Gulf air, as in Texas, can produce massive <B>squall lines</B> of thunderstorms, stretching for hundreds of miles, filling the sky with vast gray clouds, rain, wind, hail, lightning, and, worst of all, tornadoes.  These conditions get called, with charming understatement, "severe weather."  Short of hurricane force winds, or actual tornadoes, nature provides no more awesome weather.  During one overnight thunderstorm and flash flood that I witnessed in Austin, Texas, on the eve of <a href="ross/ross-5.htm#wholeflood">Memorial Day in 1981</a>, where serious flooding and deaths occurred, <img src="images/cloud-az.gif" align=left>the flashes of lightning were so frequent that they were right on top of each other and the night was literally without darkness.

<P>I also see other cloud symbols, such as the altostratus plus cirrus symbol at left.  I have yet to see exactly what this would look like in the sky, but I like how this looks.<br clear=left>

<H3 ALIGN="center">Note on Dew Point</H3>

<p><center><img src="images/key.gif"></center>

<P><img src="images/greek/winds-s.gif" align=right>The dew point tells us the <B>absolute humidity</B>.  The more commonly used "relative humidity" is the <I>percentage</I> to which the air is saturated with moisture.  The dew point is simply the temperature at which the air would <I>be</I> saturated, would have 100% relative humidity.  Warmer air can hold more moisture, so that air that would be saturated at 75<sup>o</sup>F, with 100% relative humidity, would only have about 50% relative humidity if the temperature rises to 95<sup>o</sup>F without any moisture being added.  While people complaining of summer humidity often say that both the temperature and the relative humidity must both be 90 or more, this really does not happen and would be deadly if it did.  Typical summer dew points in Texas are around 75<sup>o</sup>F, as in the example just cited.  The highest dew point I've ever heard of was 80<sup>o</sup>, reported by <a href="http://www.weather.com/">The Weather Channel</a> at places in eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey as a line of thunderstorms was arriving in June 1998 (I was nearby in New Jersey -- it <I>was</I> humid).  Typical summer dew points in Los Angeles are in the 50's.  Extremely humid summer conditions in Los Angeles usually only mean dew points in the 60's.  Autumn arrives in Los Angeles in October, when dry air (and sometimes a Santa Ana wind) arrives with the first cold front, dropping the dew point precipitously.  October 20, 1996, the dew point in Van Nuys was reported at 37<sup>o</sup>, the 21st at 14<sup>o</sup>, and the 22nd at 9<sup>o</sup>.    October 7, 1997, the dew point was reported at 39<sup>o</sup> and the 15th at 25<sup>o</sup>.  October 5, 1998, the dew point was reported at 13<sup>o</sup> and the 17th at 19<sup>o</sup>.  Although understanding the dew point in abstraction, its real connection to the <I>feel</I> of the air was not obvious to me until I began seeing dew point isotherm maps on The Weather Channel in the 1980's.

<P>Since air can hold about twice as much moisture for every 20 degrees Fahrenheit, this may be used to write very simple equations for the dew point.  In the following equations, D is the dew point in degrees Fahrenheit, T is the air temperature, and H is the relative humidity written as a whole number percentage (i.e. "50" instead of "0.5" for "50%").  The first equation gives the dew point for the temperature and relative humidity, which is usually what one can easily determine, while the second equation gives the relative humidity from the temperature and dew point.


<P>D = T - 20*((2 - log H)/log 2)
<br>log H = 2 - ((log 2*(T-D))/20)

<P><table border cellpadding=5 bgcolor="#ffffff" align=right>
<tr><td>
<P>C = 5*(F - 32)/9
<br>C = (5*(F + 40)/9) - 40
<br>F = (9*C/5) + 32
<br>F = (9*(C + 40)/5) - 40
</td></tr></table>

A more precise value for the dew point can be derived from the equations below.  For the main equation, the value "X" must be calculated first, based on the relative humidty.  The temperature and dew point here will be in degrees Celsius (or centigrade).  Celsius and Fahrenheit can be converted back and forth with the equations in the box at right.  (Note that the equations that add and subtract 40, in precisely the same way, may be easier to remember than the more traditional conversion equations.)

<P>X = 1 -(.01*H)
<br>D = T - (14.55+.114*T)*X - ((2.5+.007*T)*X)<sup>3</sup> - (15.9+.117*T)*X<sup>14</sup>

<P>If we have a temperature of 73<sup>o</sup>F (22.8<sup>o</sup>C) at 24% relative humidity, the Fahrenheit equation gives us a dew point of 3l.8<sup>o</sup>F.  The Celsius equation gives us a dew point of 1.1<sup>o</sup>C, or 34.0<sup>o</sup>F.  An error of 2.2<sup>o</sup>F, or 1.2<sup>o</sup>C, is not bad, especially considering how much easier the Fahrenheit equation is to use.

<P>My favorite personal experience with dew point was when I drove from Austin, Texas, to Tularosa, New Mexico, in June 1982.  A cold drink in Texas  causes a large amount of moisture to condense on a glass.  It "sweats"; and the water collects on the table or in a coaster, sometimes so much that it makes it seem like the glass is leaking.  Arriving in New Mexico at my aunt and uncle's place, the next day I had a glass of iced tea sitting on the broad arm of a wooden chair.  After half an hour, I checked the glass to make sure that there wasn't any condensing water that might damage the wood.  There wasn't.  At an elevation of over 4000 feet, far from the Gulf Coast, the relative humidity might only have about 5% or so.

<H1 align=center>Snow, Sleet, Ice, and Rain</H1>

<p><center><img src="images/key.gif"></center>

<P><img src="images/ice.gif" align=right>The temperatures of the air produce different phenomena of precipitation.  The most familiar are <B>snow</B> and <B>rain</B>.  In the former, ice crystals fall through air that is below freezing from the clouds to the surface.  Snow then accumulates in drifts on the ground.  The water content of snow can vary, so that some times it is dry, light, and fluffy, other times wet, heavy, and dense.  Wet snows can adhere, so that drifts can appear to flow or sag without breaking apart.  With rain, water droplets fall through air that is above freezing.  Puddles accumulate on the ground, or the water flows away.

<P>Other forms of precipitation occur when the air temperature changes from above freezing to below between the clouds and the surface.  If the boundary occurs high enough, there is time for rain droplets to freeze before hitting the ground.  This is <B>sleet</B>.  As solid little ice pellets, sleet will tend to fall faster than snow and will hit surfaces with some noise.  A snow fall is silent.  Sleet can sound like small hail.  When it accumulates on the ground, sleet can look a bit like snow, but the consistency and the color will look a bit different.<br clear=right>

<P><img src="images/ice.gif" align=right>If the boundary between the air above freezing and below freezing is close enough to the surface, we get <B>freezing rain</B>.  This is one of the rarer of these phenomena, and its effects are striking and dangerous.  Rain drops hit surfaces and freeze.  This produces a <B>glaze</B> of ice on amost anything and a surface of "black" ice on streets.  An accumulation of ice becomes heavy.  Branches, trees, and power lines can easily be brought down in an ice storm.  Driving is treacherous.  Some of the dangers involved can be seen in the Ang Lee movie <I>The Ice Storm</I> [1997], where the weather ends up being incidental and symbolic (with the tragic ending of the movie left rather hanging).  In the daylight after an ice storm, everything looks like it is wrapped in glass.  This can be extraordinarily beautiful, but it may be purchased at a terrible price in damage and even lives.

<P><B>Hail</B> is produced when updrafts carry rain drops high into clouds, and into freezing air at altitude, even during warm times of the year.  The rain drop freezes and may fall, or it may be carried up into the clouds again and receive a further coating of ice.  This can happen over and over again, producing ever larger hail stones.  Hail is thus usually characterized by its size, ranging from pea sized to grapefruit sized.  The latter, of course, can cause sever damage or injury when it finally falls to the ground.  I never saw more than the (rare) pea sized hail in Los Angeles, but I also got caught in heavy hail on I-90 outside Chamberlain, South Dakota, in July 2010, which dented my car, although not nearly as bad as with some cars I've seen.  Some of the hailstones on that occasion seemed to be golf-ball sized.

<P><B>Snowfall</B> is measured by its depth, but what that depth will be is variable relative to temperature and humidity.  Thus, if snow is falling into air slightly above freezing, such as at 34<sup>o</sup>F, what would have been an <B>inch</B> of rain will result in <B>seven inches</B> of "wet" snow (a 7:1 ratio).  Wet snow can have a spectacular look, since, as noted above, it will tend to cling to branches and pile on narrow walls, can sag or <I>flow</I> off the walls or from steep surfaces, like roofs, and hang in waves or tongues that seem to defy gravity.  At freezing, the snow is drier and will accumulate at about <B>ten inches</B> for an inch of rain (10:1).  Colder temperatures mean drier snow yet, so that at 28<sup>o</sup> we get more like <B>fiften inches</B> of <I>powdery</I> snow for an inch of rain (15:1).  Wet snow, of course, is also heavier, which is more of a strain for shoveling.  I've also experienced the phenomenon, trying to dig out a car, that wet snow with above freezing temperatures, which melts a bit and then perhaps freezes overnight, produces a hard layer of ice, which may need to be broken before shoveling is even possible.  I didn't need to worry about things like that when I was a resident of <a href="ross/drives.htm#child">Los Angeles</a>.
