<P><a name="text-1">While the old gods of the Vedas</a> (Indra, Agni, Dyaus, Mitra, Varuna, etc. [<a href="#note-0">note</a>]) <img src="images/tri-2.gif" align=right>eventually were demoted by Hinduism to a position inferior to the Vedas themselves, in the Upanis.ads <B>Brahman</B> came to be conceived as the Supreme Being, or just Being -- the One.  According to the Dvaita Ved&acirc;nta interpretation of the Upanis.ads, Brahman is a personal God, distinct from individual souls (atmans) and from matter [<a href="#note-1">note</a>].  Such a personal Brahman, whether formulated philosophically or not, comes to be identified in popular religion with either Vis.n.u or Shiva.  Since different gods are thus proposed as the One God, Hinduism is an unusual kind of monotheism:  &nbsp;it contains virtual sub-religions consisting of the devotees of Vis.n.u, the Vaishnavites, and the devotees of Shiva, the Shaivites.  It is best to see this as an instance of the "<a href="greek.htm">multiplicity of explanations</a>."  There is no doctrinal authority in Hinduism to straighten this out, and the Sects generally get along with each other, acknowledging, after a fashion, each other's Gods; so the <I>status quo</I> seems acceptable to all.

<P><a name="text-2">On the other hand, the earlier (and perhaps more faithful) interpretation of the Upanis.ads is found in the Advaita Ved&acirc;nta of Shankara [<a href="#note-2">note</a>], where Brahman is identical with the &Acirc;tman and is an impersonal Absolute beyond any devotionalistic Gods [<a href="#note-3">note</a>].  Since the personal Gods could all be seen on the same footing in relation to an impersonal Brahman, an attempt was made, we know not by whom, to tidy up things through the doctrine of the <B>Trim&ucirc;rti</B>:

<P><img src="images/tri.gif" align="left">

<P><B>Brahm&acirc;</B> (the <I>masculine</I> form of Brahman), was a creator God in the Vedas (more or less identifiable with <B>Prajapati</B>), but he is actually not an important devotionalistic God.  One story about Vis.n.u is that as he sleeps, dreaming the universe, a lotus grows from his navel and opens to reveal Brahm&acirc;, who then creates worlds as he blinks his eyes.  Brahm&acirc; is awake for a <I>kalpa</I>, or a Day of Brahm&acirc;, which is either 12 million years or 4 billion years.  <a name="text-4">He then sleeps for another <I>kalpa</I>, a Night of Brahm&acirc;, while all <a href="karma.htm">karma</a> sleeps within him.  After 36,000 Days and Nights, called the Life of Brahm&acirc; (859 billion or 309 trillion years), Brahm&acirc; dies, and all karma is annihilated.  But then a new lotus grows from Vis.n.u's navel, and another Brahm&acirc; is born [<a href="#note-4">note</a>].

<P>The most important feature of the cult of <B>Vis.n.u</B> is the belief that he periodically causes himself to be born as a being in the world.  He does this out of compassion, and this is probably responsible for his epithet as the "Preserver."  As Krishna says in the <I>Bhagavad Gita</I> (Chapter 4, Juan Mascar&oacute; translation, Penguin, 1962):

<P><blockquote>[7]  Although I am unborn, everlasting, and I am the Lord of all, I come to my realm of nature and through my wondrous power I am born.

<P>[8] When righteousness is weak and faints and unrighteousness exults in pride, then my Spirit arises on earth.

<P>[9] For the salvation of those who are good, for the destruction of evil in men, for the fulfillment of the kingdom of righteousness, I come to this world in the ages that pass. </blockquote>

<P>In the cycle of time within which we live, called a <I>Mah&acirc;yuga</I> (either 12 thousand or 4.3 million years), there are supposed to be ten Incarnations (or <I>Avatars</I>) of Vis.n.u.  Nine have come already:  &nbsp;1) as the Fish, 2) the Tortoise, 3) the Boar, 4) the Man-Lion, 5) the Dwarf, 6) Parashur&acirc;ma, 7) R&acirc;ma (of the <I>R&acirc;m&acirc;y&acirc;na</I>), 8) Kr.s.n.a (Krishna, of the <I>Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata</I>), and 9) the Buddha.  As the Buddha, however, Vis.n.u is supposed to have taught a deliberately <I>false</I> doctrine (which is how Hinduism always sees Buddhism), to destroy demons.  The tenth Avatar, Kalkin, will usher in the end of the world (or the end of the <I>Mah&acirc;yuga</I>).

<P><center><img src="images/vishnu2.gif"></center>

<P>The most important feature of the cult of <B>Shiva</B> is perhaps his sexual complexity.  This may come in answer to a difficulty that the chart of the <img src="images/devi-2.gif" align=right>Trim&ucirc;rti may suggest.  Each of the Gods is married, but the presence of a wife is a little awkward if the deity is to be considered the Supreme Being -- there is no Mrs. God in the Old Testament.  The solution is that the goddesses are really the female aspect of the God, not separate beings.  Thus Shiva as a whole may be divided into male and female sides.  This can be artistically represented either by showing Shiva as half male and half female, or by showing Shiva and P&acirc;rvat&icirc; locked together in intercourse.  Much the same thing is shown through the union of the Shaivite fetish objects, the <I>linga</I> cone and the <I>yoni</I> ring or table.

<P>This sets off a chain reaction of belief.  The male side of the God is contrasted, as remote and detached, with the female side, which comes to be seen as the <I><B>shakti</B></I>, the active power and energy of the God.  Then <I>all</I> goddesses are seen as active, powerful, and creative, and finally assimilated, more or less, into a sense of One Goddess, Shakti, who contains all power.  This effectively eliminates the need for a creator Brahm&acirc;, and gives rise to, virtually, a third sub-religion:  &nbsp;Sh&acirc;kta, or Tantrism (named after its texts, the <I>Tantras</I>).  The Trim&ucirc;rti thus might be refigured this way (though, evidently, it hasn't been so far):

<P><img src="images/newtri.gif" align="left">

<P>On the other hand, there are goddesses and there are goddesses.  Some goddesses, like P&acirc;rvat&icirc; herself, are basically positive, protective, and reassuring; others and basically destructive, terrifying, and spooky.  K&acirc;l&icirc; is the most famous in that respect (thanks in part to the Hollywood exaggerations in <I>Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom</I>).  Shiva as a whole might be divided, not just into male and female sides, but with the female side divided into peaceful and terrible sides:

<P><img src="images/devi.gif" align="left">

<P>The most fearful manifestation of the cult of K&acirc;l&icirc; was the murderous secret society of her followers, the <I>Thugs</I> (pronounce the "th" like a "t"; there is no "th" sound, as in "thin," in Indian languages).  <I>Thugee</I> was the practice of murder and robbery by the Thugs, who strangled travelers in their sleep.  They saw these murders as offerings to K&acirc;l&icirc;.  The British decided this should not be tolerated, so they actually infiltrated the society and stamped it out.<br clear=left>

<P>A very nice statement of the complex of the devotionalistic Gods can be found by George Michell, in <I>The Hindu Temple, An Introduction to its Meaning and Forms</I> [University of Chicago Press, 1977, 1988]:

<P><blockquote>Innumerable gods and goddesses are found throughout the mythology and art of Hinduism, but the history of this religion at its highest devotional level is mostly bound up with the simultaneous development of two major cults -- those of the male gods Shiva and Vishnu.  A third cult is also of importance -- that of the Mother or the Goddess -- but is rarely seen in isolation, as the Goddess is essentially the consort of Shiva.  These cults are synthetic in character owing to their evolution as amalgamations of many different minor deities.  Shiva, Vishnu, and the Goddess are compound creations with a wide range of divine powers and richly paradoxical personalities.  The majority of Hindus ally their beliefs with one or other of these cults, worshipping Shiva, Vishnu, or the Goddess as the highest principle.  In devoting themselves to one of these three deities Hindus do not deny the existence of the other two, who are regarded as minor expressions of the divine power.  Thus in the cult of Shiva, Vishnu is considered an unimportant aspect, whereas in the cult of Vishnu, Shiva is reduced to a secondary emanation.  To the worshipper of the Goddess, the male gods are mostly passive and shadowy figures.

<P>In general, the cults of Hinduism developed peacefully together and only rarely is there any evidence of friction or religious persecution.  The reason for this mutual co-existence is to be found in the belief that the ultimate godhead lies beyond the divisions of cult and that the worship of Shiva, Vishnu or the Goddess leads inevitably to the same same goal. [p.23]
</blockquote>

<P>As I have noted, however, this latter is not quite right, only holding true for the School of "unqualified" <a href="six.htm">Advaita Ved&acirc;nta</a>, not for "qualified" Advaita Ved&acirc;nta or Dvaita Ved&acirc;nta, where the "ultimate godhead," Brahman, is a personal Deity identified with a devotionalistic God.  Michell may have gotten the wrong impression because the "unqualified" doctrine is both more intriguing to Western investigators (already familiar with personal Monotheism) and more to the taste of most recent Indian philosophers.  The real reason for the co-existence of the cults may just be that they identify each other's Gods with aspects of their own.  Or, it may simply be that Hindus are aware that there are many gods in their religion, and they do not regard the status of other devotionalistic Gods as different from the surviving gods of the Vedas.<br clear=left>

<H2 align=center>The 33 Gods of the Vedas</H2>

<p><center><img src="images/key.gif"></center>

<P>Traditionally, there are thirty-three gods in the Vedas.  There are really many more, however, and the list of the thirty-three can vary.  There is also the problem than the gods come in groups, and what the groups are even varies.  According to the <a href="upan.htm#upan"><I>Br.had&acirc;ran.yaka Upanis.ad</I></a>, there are eight <B>Vasus</B>, eleven <B>Rudras</B>, twelve <B>&Acirc;dityas</B>, <B>Indra</B>, and <B>Praj&acirc;pati</B> [<I>Upanis.ads</I>, translated by Patrick Olivelle, Oxford, 1996, p.46].  Instead of Indra and Praj&acirc;pati, however, we may find the two <B>Ashvins</B>, or an extra Vasu or &Acirc;ditya, or the <B>Creator Brahm&acirc;</B> (for the Creator Praj&acirc;pati).  There are also the <B>Maruts</B>, which may mean the Rudras, or may be different.

<P>The Vasus represent different natural elements:  &nbsp;(1) <B>Dhava</B> or <B>Dhar&acirc;</B> for earth, (2) <B>Aha</B> for space (or <B>Ap</B> for water), (3) <B>Dyaus</B> (or <B>Prabh&acirc;sa</B>, dawn) or for the sky, (4) <B>Dhruva</B> for the polestar or constellations, (5) <B>Agni</B> (or <B>Anala</B> or <B>P&acirc;vaka</B>) for fire, (6) <B>V&acirc;yu</B> (or <B>Anila</B>) for wind, (7) <B>S&ucirc;rya</B> (or <B>Praty&ucirc;s.a</B>) for the sun, (8) and <B>Soma</B> for the moon.  Also taken as Vasus can be <B>Indra</B>, <B>Vis.n.u</B>, <B>Shiva</B> (and/or <B>Rudra</B>), <B>Kubera</B>, an even the <B>Ashvins</B> and <B>&Acirc;dityas</B>.  Dawn can also be the goddess <B>Us.as</B>.  In the <a href="gita.htm#bharat"><I>Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata</I></a>, Bhis.ma is supposed to be the incarnation of a Vasu, perhaps Dyaus.  With the P&acirc;n.d.avas, Bh&icirc;ma is supposed to have been fathered by V&acirc;yu, Arjuna by Indra, Nakula and Sahadeva by the Ashvins, and their half-brother Karn.a by S&ucirc;rya.

<P>The &Acirc;dityas were at first <B>Mitra</B>, <B>Varun.a</B>, <B>Aryaman</B>, <B>Bhaga</B>, <B>Amshu</B>, <B>Indra</B>, <B>Daks.a</B>, and <B>Vivasvat</B>, then to be joined by <B>Tvas.t.r.</B>, <B>P&ucirc;s.an</B>, <B>Savitr.</B>, <B>Shakra</B>, and <B>Vis.n.u</B>.  These thirteen can be limited to the canonical twelve by leaving out Indra.

<P>The Rudras were at first eight, <B>Bhava</B>, <B>Sharva</B>, <B>Pashupati</B>, <B>Ugra</B>, <B>Mah&acirc;deva</B>, <B>Rudra</B>, <B>Ish&acirc;na</B>, and <B>Ashani</B>, later a rather different eleven, <B>Mahan</B>, <B>Mah&acirc;tman</B>, <B>Matiman</B>, <B>Bh&icirc;s.an.a</B>, <B>Bhayamkara</B>, <B>R.tudhvanja</B>, <B>&Ucirc;rdhvakesha</B>, <B>Pingal&acirc;ks.a</B>, <B>Ruci</B>, <B>Shuci</B>, and <B>Rudra</B>.

<P>The Maruts, when they are not just the Rudras, can be seven storm gods, named after winds, <B>V&acirc;yuvega</B>, <B>V&acirc;yubala</B>, <B>V&acirc;yuh&acirc;</B>, <B>V&acirc;yuman.d.ala</B>, <B>V&acirc;yujv&acirc;la</B>, <B>V&acirc;yuretas</B>, <B>V&acirc;yucakra</B>.  Or we can have eleven Maruts, <B>Mr.gavy&acirc;dha</B>, <B>Sarapa</B>, <B>Nirr.ti</B>, <B>Ajaikap&acirc;da</B>, <B>Ahirbudhnya</B>, <B>Pin&acirc;kin</B>, <B>Dahana</B>, <B>&Icirc;shvara</B>, <B>Kap&acirc;lin</B>, <B>Sth&acirc;n.u</B>, and <B>Bhaga</B>.

<P>The P&acirc;n.d.ava Yudhis.t.hira is fathered by <B>Dharma</B>, Law or Duty, but not a god who otherwise fits into the traditional thirty-three.  The Ashvins, "horsemen," are the physicians of the gods, and sound very much like the Dioskuroi (Latin Dioscuri or Gemini) in Greek mythology.

<P>Many of these gods are not from the oldest parts of the <a href="upan.htm#veda">Vedas</a>, but from personifications and systematizations in the Br&acirc;hman.as and later.  All these many gods I refer to as "gods" with a small "g."  They are not unique or ultimate beings.  However, the devotionalistic Deities, like Vis.n.u and Shiva, I call "Gods" with a capital "g" because in their cults and in philosophical schools they may be considered the unique and ultimate Supreme Being, the equivalent of a personal Brahman.

The world we are familiar with is that of our <I>Mah&acirc;yuga</I>, or &aelig;on.  This is divided into the <I>Kr.tayuga</I> of 4800 years, the <I>Tret&acirc;yuga</I>, of 3600 years, the <I>Dv&acirc;parayuga</I>, of 2400 years, and the <I>Kaliyuga</I>, of 1200 years.  These decline in quality as well as in length, and can be characterized as the golden, the silver, the bronze, and the iron ages, respectively.  We are in the <I>Kaliyuga</I>, which is supposed to have begun around 900 BC, at the time of the climactic battle in the <a href="gita.htm#bharat"><I>Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata</I></a>.  However, it has now obviously been much more than 1200 years since then, so the reckoning now is that the 12,000 years of the <I>Mah&acirc;yuga</I> are not ordinary human years, but "years of the gods," which are 360 human years.  <img src="images/brahma.gif" align=left>Thus, the <I>Mah&acirc;yuga</I> is 4,320,000 years long, and the <I>Kaliyuga</I> 432,000.  In those terms, the <I>Kaliyuga</I> is supposed to have begun, still with the battle in the <I>Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata</I>, on 18 February 3102 BC (identified by the Arab historian al-B&icirc;r&ucirc;n&icirc; [973-1048]).  However, the original <I>Mah&acirc;yuga</I>, at 12,000, is already about as long as the <a href="distanc2.htm">Holocene Epoch</a>.  The larger numbers go way beyond identifiable events in recorded history, human history, or geological time.

<P>The <I>Kaliyuga</I> is an age of decline and decadence, with the P&acirc;n.d.avas preserving as much good as they could from the previous <I>yuga</I>.  This is rather like Tolkien's sense, in <a href="ents.htm"><I>The Lord of the Rings</I></a>, that great things are passing away (like the Elves), but as much good is preserved as possible.  At the end of the <I>Mah&acirc;yuga</I> will be some sort of Apocalypse, either destroying the world or renewing it in some less catastrophic sense.

Seventy-one <I>mah&acirc;yugas</I> make a <I>manvantara</I>.  This will be either 852,000 years or, with the years of the gods, 306,720,000 years.  Fourteen <I>manvantaras</I> make a <I>kalpa</I>.  The <I>kalpa</I>, as described in the text, is thus 11,928,000 or, with the years of the gods, 4,294,080,000 years.  A Day and a Night of Brahm&acirc;, each a <I>kalpa</I>, are multiplied by 360 to give a Year of Brahm&acirc; (8,588,160,000 or 3,091,737,600,000 years); and 100 years of Brahm&acirc; make the Life of Brahm&acirc; (858,816,000,000 or 309,173,760,000,000 years).  During the Night of Brahm&acirc;, Brahm&acirc; sleeps and there is no world.  All <a href="karma.htm">karma</a> sleeps with Brahm&acirc;.  When Brahm&acirc; awakes, the world is created as he opens his eyes.  The other cycles, as worlds are created and destroyed, are when Brahm&acirc; blinks.  After a Life of Brahm&acirc;, all karma is annihilated.  But Brahm&acirc; is reborn, born from a lotus that grows from the navel of the sleeping Vishnu.

<P>The <I>kalpa</I> is also a basic unit of <a href="buddhism.htm">Buddhist</a> cosmology, although there are different versions of it.  Thus a Buddhist <I>kalpa</I> can be 15,998,000 years long, comparable to the shorter version of the Hindu <I>kalpa</I>, or it can be "incalculable" in length.  Eighty such <I>kalpas</I> make a <I>mah&acirc;kalpa</I>, "Great Kalpa," but even this is a fraction of the <I>asam.khya kalpa</I>, which is a multiple of 10<sup>59</sup> <I>kalpas</I> (of one kind or another).  Three <I>asam.khya kalpas</I> are necessary for someone to become a Buddha.  This is discussed in detail by Akira Sadakata in <I>Buddhist Cosmology</I> [K&ocirc;sei Publishing Co., Tokyo, 1997, pp.96-97].  The Hindu periods are explained by A.L. Basham, in <I>The Wonder That Was India</I> [Rupa & Co., Calcutta, Allahabad, Bombay, Delhi, 1954, 1967, 1981, 1989, p.323].

<P>This story is an example of how ordinary human beings can be morally and spiritually superior to the gods, even the great Sectarian Gods of Hinduism, and how the philosophical side of the Hindu tradition can regard devotionalistic religion, and the Gods themselves, with contempt.  This is a characteristic of Indian religion, absolutely dominant in Jainism and <a href="buddhism.htm">Buddhism</a>, but co-existing with devotionalistic <a href="#">theism</a> in Hinduism.  It is a characteristic of the philosophical side of Hinduism but is also to be found in non-philosophical literature, such as this <I>Pur&acirc;n.a</I>.

<P>The text is based on the translation by Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty in <I>Hindu Myths</I> [Penguin Books, 1975, pp.53-55].  Doniger uses it as an example of the "Degradation of Brahm&acirc;," but all three devotionalistic Gods are degraded in the same way.

<P>Alternative name for <I>Vis.n.u</I>.  Another name used here for him is <I>V&acirc;sudeva</I>.

<P><blockquote>and <I>Shambhu</I>,</blockquote>

<P><img src="images/vishnu.gif" align=right>Alternative name for <I>Shiva</I>.  Other names used for him here are <I>Rudra</I> and <I>Hara</I>.

<P><blockquote>approached him, each mounted on his own vehicle,</blockquote>

<P>The sacred animals of the Gods:  &nbsp;the bull <I>Nandi</I> for <I>Shiva</I>, the eagle <I>Garud.a</I> for <I>Vis.n.u</I>, and a goose (!) for <I>Brahm&acirc;</I>.  There is a more dignified vehicle for <I>Brahm&acirc;</I>, however, the lotus.  Note that the national airline of predominately Muslim Indonesia is named "Garuda."  This is probably because much of Indonesian tourism goes to the Island of Bali, which is still Hindu in religion.

<P><blockquote>and told him to choose a boon.</blockquote>

<P><img src="images/shiva.gif" align=right>The Gods are respectful and reverential towards Atri for his spiritual attainments.  Also, the fact that <I>all three</I> Gods show up indicates that this is not a Shaivite or Vais.n.avite devotionalistic document, for in that case there would only be one God.

<P><blockquote> The sage, who was the son of the Self-created <I>Praj&acirc;pti</I>,</blockquote>

<P>A Creator who sometimes is even identified with <I>Brahm&acirc;</I>.

<P><blockquote> heard their speech but did not say anything in reply, for he was firmly immersed in the highest Self.</blockquote>

<P>i.e. the <I>&acirc;tman</I>.

<P><blockquote>  Observing his emotion, the three eternal Gods went to his wife Anas&ucirc;y&acirc; and spoke to her.  <I>Rudra</I> himself had a <I>linga</I></blockquote>

<P>The <I>linga</I> or <I>lingam</I> is the sacred phallus of <I>Shiva</I>, usually a stone cone found on a table that represents the <I>yoni</I> or female organ of his wife <I>P&acirc;rvat&icirc;</I>.  Here, however, what <I>Shiva</I> is holding may be more personal.

<P><blockquote> in his hand; <I>Vis.n.u</I> was exhilarated with desire for her; <I>Brahm&acirc;'s</I> godhead was annulled by lust, and he was entirely in the power of <I>K&acirc;ma</I>.</blockquote>

<P>Pleasure, here personified as a goddess, or The Goddess (<I>Mah&acirc;dev&icirc;</I>), to whom there is reference later.

<P><img src="images/goddess.gif" align=right><blockquote>He said, "Grant me sexual pleasure, or I will abandon my life's breath, for you have caused me to whirl about drunk with passion."  When Anas&ucirc;y&acirc;, who was true to her vow to her husband, heard their improper speech she did not say anything in reply, for she feared the anger of the Gods.  But the Gods, out of their minds, grabbed her by force and prepared to rape her, for they were deluded by the Goddess's magic power.

<P>Then the sage's beloved and faithful wife became angry and cursed them, saying, "You will be my sons, for you have been infatuated by desire.  The <I>linga</I> of the great god, the great head of <I>Brahm&acirc;</I> here,</blockquote>

<P><I>Brahm&acirc;'s</I> head has faces on front, back, and sides.

<P><blockquote>and the two feet of <I>V&acirc;sudeva</I></blockquote>

<P><I>Vis.n.u</I>, in his fifth incarnation as the Dwarf, paced off the size of the world in three strides, rendering his feet holy.

<P><blockquote>will always be worshipped by men, and so the supreme Gods will be the supreme laughing-stock."  When they heard this terrible speech, they bowed to the sage's beloved wife, bent low with reverence, and praised her with Vedic verses as recited by the gods.  Then Anas&ucirc;y&acirc; said, "When you are my little sons, you will be freed from my curse and you will be content."  Then <I>Brahm&acirc;</I> became Candramas, <I>Hari</I> became Datt&acirc;treya, and the lord <I>Hara</I> became incarnate as Durv&acirc;sas.  And they all became yogis in order to dispel that evil.</blockquote><P>
