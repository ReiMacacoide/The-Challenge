<I>ATTENDANCE:</I>  This is primarily a <I>lecture</I> class:  tardiness
     and absences thus will result in missing material that cannot be found
     in the texts <I>or</I> in other sources.  The texts are primary
     sources which are not self-explanatory; and you will <I><B>not</B></I>
     find what I talk about in encyclopaedia articles or in most other
     books.  Believe me, you <I><B>will not do well</B></I> in the
     class unless you are present for the lectures or arrange to obtain
     lecture notes, and it is <I>your responsibility</I> to arrange with
     others to obtain the materials for classes that you miss.
     You may tape record lectures.

     Attendance will be taken for each class meeting.  Excessive absences
     (more than 3 weeks) <I>may</I> subject you to <I>exclusion</I> or <I>reduction in grade</I>.
     It is your own responsibility to drop the class if you wish to do so
     (final drop date:  <B>November 23rd</B>).  You will not be penalized if absent
     for religious, work-related, or serious personal reasons, but I <I>will</I>
     exclude people if in my judgment their absences are so numerous as to
     preclude a proper understanding of the course.

     Holidays this semester are Labor Day, September 5; Veteran's Day,
     November 11; and Thanksgiving, November 24-25.  The last day of
     classes is Thursday, December 15th.

     Note well:  Anyone who persistently disrupts my class by talking,
     arriving late, leaving early, repeatedly leaving & returning, or
     through any other distracting or inconsiderate behavior may be
     instructed to leave the class.  If you do not want to be here,
     don't come in the first place.

<I>OFFICE HOURS:</I>  My office hours are MWF 7:30-8:00 & 11:10-11:45 AM, TuTh
    6:30-6:45 PM, and by appointment in CC 224.  The phone number is (818)
    <B>947-2467</B>.  This is a direct line, and no one else will answer the phone.
    You should call during office hours.  If you call at other times, you
    can leave messages on <B>voicemail</B>.  Do <B><I>not</I></B> report absences, or your
    reasons for them, by voicemail.  Do not leave messages for me to call
    <B><I>you</I></B>, without the <B><I>times</I></B> you can be reached at your number.  I will not
    return calls if all you want is to be brought up to date for classes
    you have missed.  Any inquiries by e-mail can be answered within a
    couple of days:  <B>DrKelley at AOL.com</B>.  Identify the class in the subject
    line of the e-mail.

<I>TESTS</I>:  There will be two midterm exams and a final.  The exams will
     include multiple choice, short answer identifications, and essay
     questions.  The final exam will be <I>comprehensive</I>.  Make-up tests
     will <I>not</I> given after the original tests are handed back (after
     about a week).  If you miss a test, you <I>must</I> take the make-up
     the day that you return.  Do not ask me for a make-up tests weeks
     later.  If you miss the final and cannot take it at another time I
     have scheduled, you cannot make it up during the current semester and
     will be credited with an F <I>unless</I> you request an
     <I>Incomplete</I>--which you may do simply by leaving a message for me
     <I>before</I> I turn in the grades.

     Point values are assigned to grades as follows:  F=0, D=3, C=6, B=9,
     A=12.  Minuses subtract one point, and pluses add one.  A C+ is thus
     worth 7. The grade on the final exam will be multiplied by two
     (Midterm I + Midterm II = Final).  The lowest midterm grade (or an F
     for a missed midterm) will be dropped <I>if</I> the grade is improved
     by the substitution of the grade of the other midterm or of the final
     <U><B>with the penalty of one letter grade</B></U> (sub-tracting 3
     points).  For instance, an A+ (13) on the final means that a
     midterm grade lower than a B+ (10) is replaced with a B+.  If the
     course grade is as much as 10 (B+), <I>without rounding</I>, an A will
     be awarded.  If a 7 (C+), a B; a 4 (D+), a C; and a 1 (F+), a D.

     In all tests in my classes, you are not expected to <I>agree</I> with
     me on any issue; but you <I>are</I> expected to know what has been
     presented in the course, both in the lectures and in the books, and to
     present reasons or arguments for any views you wish to advocate.
     Outside materials or opinions are welcome so long as they are not a
     <I>substitute</I> for awareness or discussion of the materials of the
     course.

     You are expected to do your own work, so do not prepare common essays
     with your study partners.  On a test, if I read an essay that I have
     already read, I <I>will</I> grade it down.  Do not simply reproduce the
     handouts or quote from them without attribution.  I reserve the
     right to <I><B>exclude</B></I> or <I><B>fail</B></I> anyone who turns in work that they have not
     done themselves, who plagiarizes, or who cheats in any other way.  I
     apologize in advance for the security measures it has become necessary
     to take to guard against cheating on examinations.  This is irritating
     and insulting for us all.
