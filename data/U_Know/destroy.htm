<P>Japanese destroyers, starting with the <I><B>Fubuki</B></I>, <img src="images/ships/fubuki.gif" align="right">began the state of the art destroyer design for World War II.  With enclosed, double turrets and heavy gun and torpedo armament, the <I>Fubukis</I> and their successors, the "special type," set the standard for all later design -- although the Japanese desire to pack as much as possible onto the ships tended to make them top heavy.  With the design also went the tactics.

<P>As the means of protecting capital ships from torpedo boats, the kind of ship originally called the "torpedo boat destroyer" eventually, with Japanese tactics (first in the Russo-Japanese War, 1904-1905), came into its own as the <I>successor</I> to the torpedo boats.  The <B>Imperial Japanese Navy</B> (<B>IJN</B>, <B><I>Nippon Teikoku Kaigun</I></B>, <img src="images/nippon-2.gif" align=middle><img src="images/ships/navy.gif" align=middle>) had excellent torpedoes, and they planned how to use them.  Japanese torpedoes had very long ranges; but the best shot for torpedoes is always as close as possible, and the best circumstances for close shots are at night.  The Japanese navy thus drilled and planned for night combat.  Only the British Royal Navy had a similar emphasis, after their mortifying experience of the Germans escaping in the night at the battle of Jutland in 1916.

<P>The Royal Navy would use its night training to devastate the Italian navy at the battle of Matapan in 1941, but then the Japanese would frequently use their night training to devastate both the British and United States navies in 1941, 1942, and 1943.  The campaigns in Indonesia, culminating in the battle of the Java Sea, 27 February 1942, and then the long campaign in the Solomon Islands from 1942 to 1943, provided many opportunities for Japanese torpedo and night combat training to pay off.  On the other hand, the United States Navy was dominated by a group, derisively called the "Gun Club," that  emphasized tactics based on gunnery.  American torpedoes, poor in themselves, were actually removed from cruisers.  There would be hell to pay for this bias.

<P><img src="images/ships/flag-jak.gif" align="left"><img src="images/ships/flag-0.gif" align="right">The supreme achievements of Japanese torpedo and night combat were the battles near Guadalcanal of Savo Island, 9 August 1942, and Tassafaronga, 30 November 1942.  The Savo Island force, ironically, consisted entirely of cruisers, except for a single pre-Fubuki destroyer, the <I>Yunagi</I>, trailing along.  But the destroyers would get their chance.  Indeed, as attrition mounted off Guadalcanal, and then the battleships <I>Hiei</I> and <I>Kirishima</I> were sunk there in the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, 12-15 November 1942, Japan gave up seriously contesting the waters, and used destroyers for such actions as were necessary -- combat and both to supply the troops on Guadalcanal and then finally to take them off.

<P><img src="images/ships/flag-4.gif" align="right">In the course of one such operation, a very superior American force surprised Japanese destroyers in the battle of Tassafaronga.  Turning away and filling the water with torpedoes, the Japanese force only lost one ship, while sinking or seriously damaging several American heavy cruisers.  For the time being, that all but knocked the American cruisers, like the Japanese, out of the war; and, mercifully, it was about the end of the line for the "Gun Club."  American destroyers finally came into their own with victory in the battle of Vela Gulf, 6/7 August 1943.  In subsequent battles in the Solomons, the Japanese were without all of their previous advantages, and their reliance on destroyers to carry the brunt of supply as well as combat actions simply meant a terrific attrition in the destroyer force.

<P><center><img src="images/key-d.gif"></center>

<P>Besides their excellent design and combat history, perhaps the most striking thing about Japanese destroyers are their names.  They were named after phenomena of weather, sea, and sky, with several groups based on wind (<img src="images/ships/wind.gif" align=middle>), snow (<img src="images/ships/snow.gif" align=middle>), rain (<img src="images/ships/rain.gif" align=middle>), clouds (<img src="images/ships/cloud.gif" align=middle>), waves (<img src="images/ships/wave.gif" align=middle>), mist (<img src="images/ships/mist.gif" align=middle>), frost (<img src="images/ships/frost.gif" align=middle>), tides (<img src="images/ships/tide.gif" align=middle>), and moons (<img src="images/ships/moon.gif" align=middle>).  In compounds, the unvoiced initial consonants of these are often voiced, e.g. <I>gumo</I> for <I>kumo</I> or <I>zuki</I> for <I>tsuki</I>.  Seldom have so many poetic names been bestowed on such devices of violence, although characteristic of the Japanese <a href="poly-1b.htm#text-8">moral aestheticism</a> that made war and death things of art and beauty.

<P>The first element of the names, although exhibiting great variation, does feature some common references, such as the seasons -- spring (<img src="images/hiero/spring0.gif" align=middle> <I>haru</I>), summer (<img src="images/hiero/summer0.gif" align=middle> <I>natsu</I>), autumn (<img src="images/hiero/autumn.gif" align=middle> <I>aki</I>), and winter (<img src="images/hiero/winter-c.gif" align=middle> <I>fuyu</I>) -- or times of day -- morning (<img src="images/hiero/morning.gif" align=middle> <I>asa</I>), evening (<img src="images/hiero/evening.gif" align=middle> <I>y&ucirc;</I>), -- etc.  The suffix <I>maru</I>, <img src="images/hiero/maru.gif" align=middle>, "circle," is commonly seen in the name of Japanese ships.  But this is not used with warships.

<P><center><img src="images/key-d.gif"></center>

<P>The "London Treaty" refers to the London Naval Treaty of 1930, under whose limitations two classes of ships were built.  The subsequent "cruiser" types, like the <img src="images/ships/yugumo.gif" align="right"><I>Yugomo</I>, were built free of the limitations of naval treaties, which had been repudiated.  They therefore represent the most advanced thinking of the Japanese naval architects.  The final "anti-aircraft" class of large destroyers is the only attempt made in this direction comparable to the American anti-aircraft light cruisers, like the <I>Atlanta</I> and <I>Juneau</I> (both tragically sunk when improperly deployed into surface combat around Guadalcanal).

<P>There are several landmarks in the history of building a ship.  A ship is (1) ordered, (2) laid down, (3) launched, (4) completed, and (5) commissioned.  "Laid down" means, of course, that construction is started.  When the hull is complete enough for the ship to float, it is launched.  Much of the construction of a ship is thus subsequent to launching.  Once the ship is completed, it can be tested at sea.  Not until the tests are completed is a ship "commissioned," which means it is accepted into active service, with a crew and commanding officer.  A commissioned ship has a watch on duty at all times, in port or at sea.  A ship that is laid up in reserve, with no crew, has been "decommissioned."  The following table gives dates for (4) completion.

<P>Several ships given here have some <I>hinagana</I> syllabic signs -- such as <img src="images/hiero/no.gif" align=middle> -- written with their names.  These are part of the dictionary rendering of the words, but the names themselves customarily are given in just characters, without <I>hiragana</I> -- although on Japanese warships the entire name was usually written in <I>hiragana</I> below the characters on the stern.  Since the pronunciation of Chinese characters in Japanese is often ambiguous, the display of the proper reading would have helped prevent possibly dangerous confusions.  The <I>hiragana</I> here can be recognized because no Chinese prounciation is given below it.  On pre-War Japanese destroyers, the name of the ship was often written in large <I>katakana</I> letters on the sides.  <I>Katakana</I> is the other Japanese syllabary, and it is used as the equivalent of italics in the Latin alphabet, i.e. for foreign names and words or for emphasis.  However, since the forms of <I>katakana</I> are in a more squarish shape than <I>hinagana</I>, unlike italic writing, which is more cursive than the default forms, <I>katakana</I> was perhaps used on the sides of destroyers as the equivalent of block capitals in the Latin alphabet.<br clear=right>

<P>The <B>Shiratsuyu</B>, <img src="images/hiero/terms-15.gif" align=middle>, bears the name of a Chinese <a href="chinacal.htm">Solar Term</a>, "White Dew."  Other names, like the <B>Akishimo</B>, <img src="images/ships/akishimo.gif" align=middle>, "Autumn Frost," contain elements that can be found among the Solar Terms.  For all the meteorological names among the destroyers, <I>Shiratsuyu</I> is the only one named for a <B>dew</B>, <img src="images/ships/dew.gif" align=middle>.

<P>One combination we do not see in ship names is <img src="images/hiero/sexual.gif" align=middle>, "clouds and rain," because this is a euphemism for sexual intercourse.  The reversal of the characters, <img src="images/hiero/rainclud.gif" align=middle>, although it can simply mean "rain cloud" (<I>amagumo</I>), is also not used, perhaps because it is too much like the former and in Chinese may sometimes actually mean the same thing.

<P>Another unused combination is <img src="images/hiero/float.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/cloud.gif" align=middle>, "Floating Cloud," an expression from Confucius, <a href="confuciu.htm#cloud"><I>Analects</I></a> VII:15, despite the many names we see based on kinds of clouds, <img src="images/ships/cloud.gif" align=middle>.  Why it is not used is a matter of some curiosity.  First, one wonders how it would be pronounced.  It could possibly be rendered <I>Ukikumo</I> -- but then in pronunciation the "i" would drop out (giving <I>Ukkumo</I>), and that seems to be something avoided for these names.  So we might try <I>Ukigumo</I>, where the voiced "k" preserves the vowel and the syllable.  As it happens, <I>ukigumo</I> actually is a word in Japanese, glossed as meaning, "a cloud drift, a floating [drifting] cloud" or "the transience of human life" [<I>Kenkyusha's New Japanese-English Dictionary</I>, Kenkyusha, Tokyo, 1974, p.1913].  Now, "drifting cloud" sounds exactly like the sort of thing we find in the destroyer names; but "the transience of human life" may be exactly what precludes this.  While, for the old Japanese <a href="divebomb.htm">ethos</a>, battle certainly embodies the transience of life, this may be rather inauspicious when applied as the name of a warship.  And the associations of "floating," <img src="images/hiero/float.gif" align=middle>, with prostitution (<img src="images/hiero/float.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/woman.gif" align=middle>, <I>ukareme</I>, "floating woman," is actually a prostitute) may really help put it off the table.  However, <img src="images/hiero/float.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/castle.gif" align=middle>, <I>ukishiro</I>, "floating castle," actually can mean "battleship."

<P>A name that it is rather a shame not to see is <img src="images/hiero/autumn.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/wind.gif" align=middle>, <B>Akikaze</B>, "Autumn Wind," which certainly is a possible name, even as it figures in the <a href="#">epigraph</a> to this page, which is a <I>waka</I> poem reportedly recited by the deceased Emperor Horikawa, who died at the age of 29, in a dream experienced by a courtier after his death and recorded in a diary.  The Emperor had had a difficult time in his final illness, and there was some question about his post-mortem fate.  The dream was taken as evidence that he had left the world of the <a href="elements.htm#china">five elements</a> and been reborn in the <a href="six.htm#tendai">Pure Land</a>, <a href="newotto.htm"><img src="images/hiero/pureland.gif" align=middle border=0></a>.

<P>Other missing combinations are <img src="images/hiero/harbor.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/wave.gif" align=middle>, <img src="images/hiero/dragon.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/roll.gif" align=middle>, and <img src="images/hiero/typhoon.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/wind.gif" align=middle>.  The first, "harbor wave," in Japanese is <I>tsunami</I>, a <a href="sangoku.htm#tsunami">tidal wave</a>.  A <I>tsunami</I> is a thing of great power and so might be a good name for a warship; but since Japan itself has often been its victim, and so has contributed its own word for the phenomenon to approved international scientific <a href="sports.htm">discourse</a>, perhaps this would strike too close to home, or be regarded as ill omened, as the name of a Japanese ship.

<P>The second expression, "dragon roll," read <I>tatsumaki</I> in Japanese, which can also be <img src="images/hiero/dragon.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/roll.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/wind.gif" align=middle> in Chinese ("dragon roll wind"), is a tornado or waterspout.  I don't hear much about tornadoes in Japan, or about damage from waterspouts, so perhaps this phenomenon just did not suggest itself to the ship namers.

<P>Third is <img src="images/hiero/typhoon.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/wind.gif" align=middle>, <I>taif&ucirc;</I> in Japanese, which is the <B>typhoon</B>, the equivalent for the Western Pacific what a <a href="wind.htm">hurricane</a> is for the Eastern Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.  This can also be written <img src="images/hiero/exalted.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/wind.gif" align=middle>, where we see that the character <img src="images/hiero/typhoon.gif" align=middle>, which is "typhoon" by itself, simply <a href="yinyang.htm#characters">combines</a> the radical for "wind" with <img src="images/hiero/exalted.gif" align=middle> as the "phonetic," to give the pronunciation.  Indeed, <img src="images/hiero/typhoon.gif" align=middle> seems to be rare enough that it does not even occur in <I>Mathews' Chinese-English Dictionary</I> [Harvard, 1972].  As the name for a ship, the problem may be the same with <I>tsunami</I>:  &nbsp;It is just too much.

<P>A notable incident in the New Georgia campaign in the <a href="history/guadal.htm">Solomon Islands</a> was the ramming and sinking of torpedo boat PT-109 by the destroyer <I>Amagiri</I>, <img src="images/ships/amagiri.gif" align=middle> on 2 August 1943.  Since PT-109 was commanded by <a href="presiden.htm#35">John F. Kennedy</a>, who was credited with heroism, this became part of the story of his Presidency.  The <I>Amagiri</I> was subsequently lost when it hit a mine while operating out of Singapore on 23 April 44.  Mines in that area were often laid from American submarines operating out of Fremantle, Australia.  My late <a href="kongo.htm#note">father-in-law</a> was actually in charge of mine-laying on such submarines.  After the War, he would follow the shipping news; and if a vessel hit an old mine around Indonesia, he would quip, "Got another one."  Perhaps he had already gotten the <I>Amagiri</I>.

<P><img src="images/ships/flag-5.gif" align="left">It is no accident that destroyers were frequently named in groups of four, e.g. four "-gumos" or "-shimos."  <img src="images/ships/flag-6.gif" align="right">Such groups of four ships would then later operate as single destroyer squadrons.  This followed British usage, where several destroyers whose names begin with the same letter, belong to the same class and operate as squadrons together.  Several squadrons, as in the following tables, would then be collected into a destroyer flotilla commanded by a Rear Admiral, who would fly his flag in one of the older cruisers.Such cruisers were so lightly armed that by World War II they were little better than large destroyers, which is how they were used -- the equivalent of what would have been called a "destroyer leader" elsewhere.<br clear=right>
