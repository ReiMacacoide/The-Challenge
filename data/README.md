# FULL WEBSITE COPY 

You like me, if we wish to, we have the right to write, or to talk, therefor to create!

Naturally we Share!

If we modify what we write in our Brain ( by personal choice aka persoanal creative condition ) 
  which motivate us to learn more, naturally all content we "create" is in fact a relationship with knowledge, 
  which can be completly different between all other, even then, mixing them, create something new!

  Like Music !

  Like Love !

  So Care to "copy" more knowledge (that you didn't find) so when is created by you, 
  
  is shared and lived by others.
